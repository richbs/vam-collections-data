It is just possible that it is a self-portrait, but this is unlikely as Belli is not known to have produced marble sculptures.\n\nBelli (around 1468-1546) was a famous engraver of hardstones and gems, in particular rock crystal. He worked at the papal court in Rome under two successive popes and also in Vicenza, his native city.  Among his masterpieces is a casket made for Pope Clement VII in 1537 and composed of 24 scenes from the life of Christ engraved on rock-crystal plaques. \n\nThe art of engraving gemstones, much admired since the early days of the Roman Empire, was revived in Europe during the Renaissance.  Enthusiasts prized and collected cameos (in which the image stands proud of the surface) and intaglios (in which the image is hollowed out of the surface). These pieces sometimes served as symbols of power and were mounted in jewelled settings, and sometimes as small objects for private devotion or enjoyment.",

            "production_note": "The relief is dated by Maclagan and Longhurst to about 1520, however Pope-Hennessy considers it to be later in date - towards the end of Belli's life or even after his death in 1546.", 
            "historical_context_note": "This is may be the same relief as one recorded in the Gualdo collection at Vicenza in\ntwo manuscript descriptions of the collection from 1644 and 1650, later published by B.Morsolin. A marble relief of Belli is later reported in the Museum Trevisanum at Venice and although they discount the Michaelangelo attribution in the two earliest documents, Maclagan and Longhurst consider it possible that the relief could have found its way to Venice at the dispersal of the Gualdo collection.     \n\nPope-Hennessy believed that the present bust definitely related to a number of profile portraits of Belli, which appear to derive from a drawing of uncertain authorship, in the Koenigs collection of the Boymans Museum, Rotterdam, which was formerly in the possession of Vasari and formed the basis of a woodcut in the second edition of his Lives of the Artists. The drawing has been variously ascribed to Michaelangelo, Luini and an unidentified Florentine artist. A medallic portrait of Belli is also connected with the drawing, though the collar, is differently rendered and the treatment of the hair less free. \nThe present relief is considered by Pope-Hennessy to be of Florentine, rather than North Italian style and it was most probably for this reason that it was ascribed verbally by Popp to Ammanati. Pope-Hennesy notes that the formulation of the dress and of the turned back collar (which do not recur in the drawing or the medal) make this attribution more likely.\n\nBorn in Vicenza, in about 1468 Valerio Belli was a  gem-engraver, goldsmith and medallist who spent the most important part of his career in Rome, where he worked for Clement VII and his successor Paul III. He spent a short period in Venice, returning from there to Vicenza in 1530 and remained in the latter city for most of the time until his death. In Rome he was a well known in artistic and literary circles, associating, for example, with Michelangelo. No specimens of his work as a goldsmith survive, but he is called \u2018aurifex\u2019 in contemporary documents and may have made the settings for his carved gems.\n\nBelli specialized in cutting gems and crystal and in carving dies for coins and medals. His style followed that of his contemporaries working in the major arts or was governed by his study of ancient coins and gems. His best-known works are those made for his papal patrons, many consisting of or incorporating carvings in rock crystal or semiprecious stones. The most splendid of these is a silver-gilt casket adorned with 24 carvings in crystal showing scenes from the Passion (1532; Florence), for which, according to Vasari, he received the large sum of 2000 gold scudi. Some of Belli\u2019s engraved crystals, such as those in the Museo Civico d\u2019Arte e Storia, Vicenza, have been separated from the works that they once adorned. Bronze plaquettes after Belli\u2019s works are sometimes found (e.g. V&A and Washington, DC, N.G.A.), produced by taking plaster or sulphur casts. Plaquettes or casts of this kind can be helpful in suggesting the form of lost works, as may be the case with the missing engraved crystals from a rock crystal Crucifix (V&A no. 755-1864), which was one of his last commissions from Clement VII.",
