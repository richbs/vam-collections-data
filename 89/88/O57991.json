The PS collection objects were characteristically simple, functional and colourful, rather than patterned, and were typical of a new spirit of functionalism that was prevelant in furniture design in the early 1990s.  The name of the collection suggests that these objects were an addition to the regular products by the company, and the PS objects were generally more expensive. Nevertheless they were more affordable than contemporary furniture by other makers. IKEA had become well-known for the low cost of its flat-pack furniture but with the PS range it introduced more cutting edge design of a quality that could rival the predominantly Italian manufacturers of contemporary furniture. Through such initiatives IKEA introduced contemporary design to a very broad new market.",

            "history_note": "This bookcase is part of a range of forty products by twenty designers launched as the Ikea PS range in 1994.  The range featured furniture and homeware by named designers, priced slightly higher than the regular Ikea ranges, but still very competitively for contemporary design.  The principles of flat-pack and self-assembly applied to all Ikea ranges were also a feature. The range was united by a common aesthetic, promoting natural materials and flat colours (rather than patterns) and simple forms.  \nThis bookcase is the high version in birch (previously birch and grey).\n\nThe folding bookcase was included in \"... not so simple\", a display of modern European design for the home shown alongside the Cologne Furniture Fair in January 1996.   \"... not so simple\" was subsequently shown at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York, 1996 (not including this bookcase), and in the Design Now Room of the Twentieth Century Gallery at the V&A, April to October 1997.  This example was borrowed from Ikea for the show at the V&A and was given to the museum for its permanent collection when the exhibition finished.  It was acquired as an example of high quality modern furniture designed for mass production.\n\nHistorical significance: The minimalist form of the bookcase is typical of the PS range and is an aesthetic which has its origins in Nordic modernist design as well as international design of the late 1980s represented by designers such as Jasper Morrison and James Irvine.  \n\nThe bookcase is also typical of Ikea products in its versatility - it can be folded in a number of configurations to suit the consumer.  Ikea has shown consistent concern with producing flexible furniture to suit modern living spaces which are often small or where rooms may be multi functional.",

            "historical_context_note": "Previous to the opening of Ikea in Britain, out-of-town warehouse furniture suppliers were perceived as downmarket. Modern design remained elite and unobtainable for the majority of the consumers. Ikea has always acknowledged the designers of their products, promoting awareness of design among customers. The objects bear names rather than model or serial numbers. The cheapness and variety of Ikea products have generated mass market sales since 1987. This demonstrates the new public acceptance of both warehouse shopping and modern design.",
