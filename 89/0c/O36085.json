The whole is cast in two halves down the length and held together by tongue and slot joints. The cowboy figure is separate and held to the horse by tongue and slot joints with the shoulders and knees loosely joined. It is lithographed tinplate showing a black and grey body with red and yellow trim and a wide red mouth. The rider is grey; green; blue; red and yellow. The clockwork mechanism is housed under the base and the integral key protrudes from the right side. The straight front legs are firmly attached while the rear ones lift up. There is a control rod from the mechanism to the chest of the horse; literally pulling it forward when wound. Unlike the German version; the hands of the rider are attached to a metal pin through the horse's upper neck and there is a second pin further down the horse's face. When the horse bucks the rider moves forward and is stopped by the second metal pin. \n*The horse and rider are the same as B127-1994 except for the structure of the legs of the horse.",
