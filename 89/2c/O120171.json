            "historical_context_note": "This bowl is an example of a mass-produced Chinese porcelain carried to Europe in Dutch ships in the late 16th/early 17th century. Since it is slightly taller and narrower than a typical Chinese bowl, and since most extant examples are in Europe or Southeast Asia rather than in China, ceramic historians believe that such a shape was made exclusively for export. The Dutch called this type of bowls 'crow cups' (Kraaikop in Dutch) because they thought the bird painted in the well of the bowl was a crow. This appellation, though convenient, provides no clues as to the function of the bowl. Fortunately two Dutch still-life paintings show similar bowls filled with berries, indicating that the bowl would have been used to contain small fruits.\nThanks to improved shipping Chinese porcelain had become more affordable to European consumers in the late 16th century. Orders from Dutch and Protuguese traders happened to arrive at Jingdezhen, the porcelain city in southern China, at a time when patronage from the Chinese court was in drastic decline. Porcelains made for the European market are of a different quality to those made for the Chinese court. The former shows a number of characteristics that make it possible for ceramic historians to study them as a distinct category, under the rubric of 'Kraak porcelain'.  \nThe glaze has a tendency to flake off on rims. With the passage of time the areas where the glaze has flaked off become black, and the piece looks like it has been bitten by small insects round the rims. This feature, called 'moth-eaten edges' by scholars, is visible on the present bowl.\nThe painted decoration is usually sketchy, the stock of designs fairly limited. The most common decorative pattern is that of panels enclosing plants or animals. The arrangements of the panels changed with times, enabling ceramic historians to work out a chronology of the production dates of Kraak porcelain.\nAlthough Kraak porcelain must have generated much income for China, Chinese records about its production and export hardly exist today. Scholars rely on records of the various East India companies in Europe. Cargoes from several shipwrecks discovered in the 20th century provide additional information about a commodity that had once played an important role in Sino-European trade.",
