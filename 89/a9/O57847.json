Marionette shows were a popular form of entertainment for adults in the 19th century, many of them family concerns which travelled around the country long before the advent of film and television, presenting shortened versions of London's latest popular entertainment from melodramas and pantomimes to minstrel shows and music hall. In the 18th and early 19th centuries their theatres were relatively makeshift, but after about 1860 many became quite elaborate, with walls constructed from wooden shutters, seating made from tiered planks of wood, and canvas roofs.\n\nThe figures were carved, painted, dressed and performed by members of the company.  This is one of two black minstrels in the collection. Minstrel shows were very popular in London from the 1840s onwards, notably in St. James's Hall in Piccadilly where they were considered family entertainment. Minstrels sang sentimental ballads and played instruments including the banjo, tambourine, one-stringed fiddle and the bones. The craze for them extended to marionette companies, all of which featured black minstrels in their troupes.",

They began working on recreating some of the puppets' original repertoire. Since the original cloths were too fragile for performance, new backdrops were painted, and in August 1951 as part of The Festival of Britain celebrations, the marionettes took to the stage again as The Old Time Marionettes, at the Riverside Theatre, Festival Gardens, Battersea Park. In the 1980s George Speaight lent the troupe to puppeteers  in Germany but in the late 1990s he sold them to John Phillips, whose widow sold them to The Theatre Museum after his death in 1998.\n\nThis marionette was used in the Variety performance preceding the production of <i>The Floating Beacon</i> at the Theatre Museum in April 2004, when he introduced the programme with his fellow Minstrel (S.293-1999) and they sang <i>Buffalo Girls Won't You Come Out Tonight?</i>",

The Moore and Burgess Minstrels, a troupe Moore later founded with Frederick Burgess, became a popular feature St James's Hall, and the craze for minstrel troupes was parodied by W.S. Gilbert in Utopia, Limited (1893).",
