            "public_access_description": "The Ardabil carpet is one of the largest and finest Islamic carpets in existence. It is also of great historical importance. It was commissioned as one of a pair by the ruler of Iran, Shah Tahmasp, for the shrine of his ancestor, Shaykh Safi al-Din, in the town of Ardabil in north-west Iran.\n\nIn a small panel at one end, the date of completion is given as the year 946 in the Muslim calendar, equivalent to 1539-40. The text includes the name of the man in charge of its production, Maqsud Kashani.\n\nThe carpet is remarkable for the beauty of its design and execution. It has a white silk warp and weft and the pile is knotted in wool in ten colours. The single huge composition that covers most of its surface is clearly defined against the dark-blue ground, and the details of the ornament - the complex blossoms and delicate tendrils - are rendered with great precision. This was due above all to the density of the knotting - there are an average of 5300 knots in every 10 square centimetres (340 knots per square inch).",

The fact that some of the small ogival medallions clustered around the lower corners and around the central medallion are noticeably distorted suggests that a sketch was used for most of the design while a cartoon was used for the detailed interlocking motifs in the yellow medallion.  The combination of sketch and cartoon was common in 16th century Persian medallion carpets. \nNote the abrash, the colour difference caused by different dye batches, in the yellow of the central medallion.",
