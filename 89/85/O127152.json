The high-waisted bodice is shaped front and back with box pleats arranged in groups of three, falling loose at the back to form a train. Variations in the depths of the individual pleats indicate that they were the principal method of fitting the gown to the wearer.\n\nThe very slight irregularities between the repeats of the pattern show that the cotton has been painted, rather than printed, and executed with great skill. The process involved applying each colour by brush or resist dyeing in stages. India was the primary source for painted cottons throughout the 18th century and those used in European dress were made expressly for export. By the 1790s, Indian textile painters had long been using European pattern books and swatches of European textiles as templates for their designs.",
