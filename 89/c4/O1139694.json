I am very forgetful of those days, and hence my non-correspondence on such important occasions - Nevertheless we have to-day drunk your very good health, most sincerely wishing you every happiness and many, very many pleasant anniversaries of it.  My sincere wish is my dear Anne, that yours may be a path through life, now you have left your 'teens', entirely strewed with roses unalloyed with thorns.  But such happiness we scarcely expect in such a state as this.  I have just had to pass a trial that was keen indeed that is, the loss of a sweet little daughter which was consigned to its last resting place on Wednesday evening.  Dear little Selina decked her little sister with fresh plucked flowers whilst she was in her coffin just before her burial and she is buried in a nice little grave, with good rich mould on the top so that Selina may plant a nice tree over her sister to mark the place of her internment.  \n\nYour dear Aunt Louisa has had a most serious illness, but owing to the kindness of an over-ruling providence I trust soon to have her restored to me in health, but she has still to be kept in the quietest state possible.\n\nI hope you have enjoyed yourself at the Crystal Palace to-day.  It is a most beautiful place.  I should much have enjoyed it if you could have spent this day here.  I must look forward to the pleasure this summer of a visit from you when (I trust it is useless for me to say it) your Aunt and myself will endeavour to make those who come as happy as we possibly can.  We have a delightful place here and I wish some of you were here to enjoy it with me. \n\nWe hope your Mama Papa Sisters and Brothers are all well.  My conscience often reproaches me for being so silent in writing to those so dear to me, but my excuse is, although I am silent my conscience tells me 'Auld acquaintance' is not forgotten.  We must soon (as soon as your Aunt is quite well again) make arrangement for you and some of the others to come down and stay with us and then you will see 'our cottage', here.\n\nI hope all in Acre Lane are well.  When you see them please give my best love to all.\n\nThe clock having just struck 5 reminds me I must stop - I will therefore end this long epistle which I flatter myself you will not cast aside as insincere and with my very best love to your Papa Mama Sisters and Brothers and no mean share for yourself\n\nBelieve me\nVery dearest Anne\nYours most affect;\nFred L.
