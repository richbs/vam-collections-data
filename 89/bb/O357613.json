It was worked with a single colour of silk, usually black, but also blue, green or red, on linen.  The abstract floral pattern and use of silver-gilt thread to fill the shapes may be a transition between the blackwork styles of the late 16th century and those of the early 17th century.\n\nUntil the end of the 17th century the coif was informal headwear for women.  Plain linen versions were worn by the working-class.  Middle-class and aristocratic women wore elaborately decorated coifs.  It would have been worn by itself indoors, or with a hat on top in public. In Western Europe it was customary for both men and women to cover their heads in public up until the 1960s. A hat was an essential part of respectable dress and, from a health perspective, head coverings were considered necessary to protect against chills and disease.",
