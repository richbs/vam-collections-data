The developing interest in heraldry coincided with the increasing use of enamel on metalwork. Enamel was the only means of permanently colouring metal and was thus a crucual technique in the expression of heraldic language. \n\nHeraldic devices such as this one were used as symbols of identity. Coats of arms also conveyed a sense of status. In England only certain individuals were given the right to bear arms by the King. Individuals often incorporated the arms of their ancestors into their heraldic devices in order to promote their position as part of an important family or dynasty.",

It would have been attached to the casket with small copper nails. \n\nThe arms upon this plaque are those of Timbor de Cabrera, wife of Juan de Fernandez, Se\u00f1or de Hijar (married 1418). Timbor de Cabrera and her husband were members of the Spanish nobility. They had family connections with the houses of Aragon and Navarre, whose heraldic devices are found on these arms. The symbol of the goat upon the coat of arms may be a pun on the family name of Cabrera. The word for goat in Spanish is <i>cabra</i>.\n\n The depiction of Timbor's arms upon a casket may indicate that the casket was a gift to her, or that she presented it as a gift.",
