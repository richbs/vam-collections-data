It is in good condition and will add significantly to our collection of early 20th century dress. The coat or fabric was probably made in Turkey for the European market. The loose cut of the coat would have complemented the flowing lines of the evening dresses of the period.  Evening wear was flamboyant and provocative. The simple cut of the clothes permitted an extravagant display of fine fabrics and jewellery.  Glossy satins and shiny metals which would catch and reflect the light were popular.  Dress fabrics also tended to be fine and delicate so lavish coats and capes would also help protect the wearer from the cool evening air. The coat was worn by the donor's grandmother, Lady Ida Dashwood.",
