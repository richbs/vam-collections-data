The pantomime was produced by Arthur Collins who worked at the Drury Lane Theatre for 43 years. He was responsible for introducing the interval to the long and spectacular pantomimes that had become an annual tradition at the Theatre Royal.\n\nComelli (1858-1925) was the house designer of the Royal Opera House from the late 1880s to the early 1920s. During this period he also worked for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and also designed costumes from a number of Gilbert&Sullivan productions.\n\nThis design comes from a collection of costume designs, some of which are costumier's copies, which were originally part of the Archives of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.",
