The colours, which include several shades of pink, green, blue, orange, grey, black, tan and white, have faded. A large elephant standing on a mound has been embroidered below an inscription which includes a verse and the maker's name and age. The elephant is set between an oak tree on the left and a palm tree on the right. A figure standing in the  branches of the oak tree  reaches out to a flock of four black birds carrying pink berries or fruits in their beaks. An exotic bird with long tail feathers perches on the top of the palm tree and a pair of tigers stand in its shade, beneath the elephant's trunk. Other small motifs including a flowering tree, heart, butterfly, strawberry and flowers have been embroidered along the upper edge of the sampler and between the elephant's legs. The sampler has been framed in a maple wood frame. This is not the orginal frame as nail marks on the sampler and areas of discolouration suggest that  it was once tacked to a stretcher.",
