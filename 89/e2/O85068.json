ISBN 1851773088.\nThis is one example from several volumes of designs for silks compiled by Anna Maria Garthwaite (English, 1690-1763), the most prominent successor to Christopher Baudouin, the founder of silk design in Britain. The design volumes were purchased by the Museum in 1868 with the express intention of encouraging and instructing students, particularly future textile designers in the Government Schools of Design. To make them exhibitable and available, the volumes were broken up and the items individually mounted, framed, and travelled in exhibitions around Britain. Although still used as a source for designers, the volumes are now regarded as key evidence in the history of silk design and production in eighteenth-century Britain.\nAlthough at first regarded to be by Garthwaite, some of these designs are now thought to be by Baudouin and collected by her. In the never-ceasing trade rivalry between Britain and Lyon, the French had undermined their own dominance in figured silk weaving. Persecuted Huguenot designers and weavers (like the Baudouin family) escaped religious intolerance in France by fleeing to England in the 1680s, where they set up a manufactory that rivalled Lyon's. Elaborate figured silks for dress and furnishings remained fashionable in Europe and America until the 1770s, but thereafter the silk weavers had to produce much simpler and smaller Neoclassical motifs and stripes to appeal to changing tastes. As late as the middle of the nineteenth century, the British government was still concerned to maintain silk weaving at Spitalfields in London-and elsewhere in Britain-although the industry was in severe decline in comparison with the massive production of printed cotton for world markets.\n\nCHARLES NEWTON",
