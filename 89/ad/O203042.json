            "history_note": "Napoleon made Saint-Cloud his preferred residence and transformed the Salon de V\u00e9nus to a throne room, which Saint-Cloud had naturally lacked, but neither he nor the occupants to follow did much more to Saint-Cloud than works of interior decoration. \nIt was at Saint-Cloud once again, in Monsieur's<i> Galerie d'Apollon</i>, that Napol\u00e9on III invested himself as Emperor of the French on 1 December 1852. During the Second Empire, Napol\u00e9on III and empress Eug\u00e9nie held court at Saint-Cloud in the spring and the autumn. Napol\u00e9on III had the orangery demolished in 1862, and Eug\u00e9nie transformed the bedroom of Madame into a salon in Louis XVI style.\nAt Saint-Cloud, Napol\u00e9on III declared war on Prussia on 28 July 1870. The heights dominating Paris were occupied by the Prussians during the siege of Paris, who shelled Paris from the grounds of the ch\u00e2teau. Counter-fire from the French hit the building, and it caught fire and burned out on 13 October 1870. Fortunately, much of its contents had been removed by Empress Eug\u00e9nie after war was declared.\nThe standing roofless walls were finally razed in 1891. The pediment of the ch\u00e2teau's right wing, one of the preserved parts of the building, was bought by Ferdinand I of Bulgaria and integrated in his palace Euxinograd on the Black Sea coast.\nToday, only a few outbuildings and its park of 460 hectares remains, constituting the Domaine national de Saint-Cloud. It includes the garden \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise designed by Le N\u00f4tre, Marie-Antoinette's flower garden (where roses for the French state are grown), a garden \u00e0 l'anglaise from the 1820s (the Trocad\u00e9ro garden), ten fountains, and a viewpoint of Paris known as \"la lanterne\", because a lantern was lit there when the Emperor Napol\u00e9on I was in residence.",
