It has a double rack of two parallel narrow slots in which the bird's heads were held. By the early 20th century game carriers were supplied by large department stores like the Army and Navy and examples can be found in their sale catalogues. A double rack to carry grouse or partridges cost 5 shillings and 9 pence in 1901. Although the object was designed as a game carrier it is thought that it was later adapted for use as a button stick. In order to prevent metal polish from staining a military uniform a button-stick was used when polishing buttons or other metal uniform mounts.  The button was passed through the circular hole at the top then moved down the vertical slot.  The wooden frame protected the uniform and also raised the button to facilitate polishing.  Early military buttons were made of pewter but by the mid-19th century most military buttons were made of brass.  To keep them bright they had to be polished regularly.\n\nHistorical Association\nBy tradition, this button-stick was used to polish the harness mounts of the horses that drew the Lord Mayor of London's ceremonial coach.  It would also be used to polish the coachman's buttons.\n\nMaterials & Making\nGame carriers for use in the field had to be hard-wearing, so were usually made of brass.",
