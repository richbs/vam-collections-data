            "physical_description": "CONSTRUCTION:The form is derived from English silver and wooden models. Raised bands round the base and near the top imitate the metal bands which would have served as supports on a wooden original.\nThe tapering body is turned, with a recessed base. The large flat handle is secured to the body by four metal pins. The lid, which overhangs the rim, has a projecting peak at one end, and hinges by means of a metal pin which passes through the handle. When closed, the lid is flush with the top of the handle.\nLACQUERING: The lacquering is thin and of poor quality, with no undercoat. The interior is lacquered reddish brown, the underside of the base is black. The exterior is black, with gold designs over a reddish brown ground. The raised bands and the handle are painted with scrolling foliage and sylized chrysanthemums. The exterior and interior of the lid are painted with flowers and foliage. The body is painted with scenes of pavilions in a mountainous landscape. The rocks show some signs of repainting.\nBought at Bonham's Sale of 'Chinese Ceramics and Works of Art', 23rd April 1982, Lot 240\nCOMPARE the style of decoration on pieces of Chinese lacquered export furniture, such as FE.54&A-1980 and FE.38-1981, particularly the stylized chrysanthemum borders.",
