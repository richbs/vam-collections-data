The painting on the off-white ground of the paper shows a stem from a flowering plant with pink blooms and buds and heart-shaped leaves with inward-curving edges. The flowers have white grounds with splashes of pink wash onto which modelling in a deeper tone of pink has been outlined or hatched.  A similar technique has been used for the leaves which are painted in two shades of green with a darker tone for the outlines and the hatched lines for modelling.\n      Small portions of a mauve flower above and a yellow one below on the right hand side can be seen, but are cut off by the strips of buff-coloured paper which have been added as a frame with black ruled lines laid on the main ivory-coloured border.  The page has lighter buff-coloured paper strips with double rows of black ruled lines stuck along its margins and a further strip of woven textile added as a gutter for the binding of the album.",

It contains 62 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
