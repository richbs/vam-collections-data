The crowned Virgin, wearing a gown with a cloak over her shoulders fastened with a brooch, kneels in adoration, hands crossed on her breast, looking down at the Child. Behind her stands the bearded St. Joseph, wearing a belted gown and a hood and also looking at the Child. In his right hand he holds a cross-staff which rests on his right foot; his left hand is raised. The midwife, Zebel, wearing a headdress, a close-fitting gown and a cloak stands on the left of the panel, hands held together in prayer. The smaller figure of the second midwife, Salome, wearing a fillet headdress and a gown, sits at her feet, hands probably together in prayer. The ox and the ass both looking very equine, feed from a manger behind the Child. The end of a scroll is visible above Zebel's head.\n\nThe Virgin's right hand is missing. The whole of the top and right corner of the panel are missing. A break from top centre to bottom left has been repaired. Salome's hands and the Child's left arm are missing.\n\nGreen paint and the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground. The mandorla, the Virgin's crown and hair and Salome's hair are gilded. There is red on the folds of Zebel's cloak and on Joseph's shoes. The hair and beard of Joseph are black. There are traces of gesso knobs in the upper background, which is gilt. A small part of the panel has been backed with slate. There are four lead-plugged holes with the remains of latten wires.",

Mary wears a crown to underline her status as Christ\u2019s mother. Medieval artists often represented Mary as a queen, though here she kneels in homage\nto the \u2018king of kings\u2019, Jesus Christ.\n\nThere are two sorts of alabaster. Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.",
