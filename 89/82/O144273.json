It had formerly been given to a British civil servant, Hormuzd Rassam, by the Ethiopian emperor Tewodros II (Theodore). In 1864, frustrated by a lack of communication from Queen Victoria\u2019s government, Tewodros had taken a number of Europeans captive, including the British consul, Captain Duncan Cameron. Rassam, who had been serving as a political agent in Aden (Yemen), was assigned the dangerous mission of delivering a letter from Queen Victoria to Tewodros which sought the captives\u2019 release. Rassam, however, was also captured and remained at Tewodros\u2019 Magdala mountain fortress until 1868 when a British military expedition defeated the emperor\u2019s forces. Shortly afterwards Tewodros committed suicide.\n\nThroughout his incarceration, Rassam remained on relatively good terms with the Ethiopian emperor and the gift of this arm guard reflects the esteem held for him by his captor.",
