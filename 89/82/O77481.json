Each Panel would have been carved separately and then fitted into the panelling.\n\nTime\nThe decoration of the panel is similar to that of surviving panelled rooms from Boughton Malherbe, Kent (built between 1520 and 1540) and Waltham Abbey, Essex (built between 1520 and 1530). The classical motif of a helmeted head within a wreathe of foliage would have been regarded as a novelty at the time.\n\nOrnament\nDesigns of heads shown in profile against a roundel background were based on Roman coins and medals. They would have been described by their makers as 'anticke work' or as 'romayne'. Such designs had first been developed on the Continent and were often used in Britain by carvers from Germany or the Netherlands who came here to seek work.",
