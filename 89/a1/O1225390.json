His photographs are a visual record of city life and local heroes, showing the impact of the black population on British culture. \n\nLondon\u2019s music scene increasingly featured the American and Caribbean sounds of soul, funk, reggae and ska during the 1960s. The Jamaican sound system concept was a popular vehicle for this music, in which crews of DJs and MCs led by a sound system operator played the latest records on large custom-built speaker systems. Starting at British Caribbean house parties and then taking residency at clubs, British sound systems, and the sound clash events in which the system crews competed, gained a strong following. \n\nVincent Forbes, known by the stage name \u2018Duke Vin\u2019 (1928-2012), was one of the first and most popular sound system operators in Britain. He moved to England in 1954 and created his sound system a year later, building on experience he had gained working as a DJ in Kingston, Jamaica as part of Tom \u2018the Great Sebastian\u2019 Wong\u2019s renowned sound system. \n\nThe V&amp;A acquired ten photographs by Charlie Phillips as part of the Staying Power project. This selection includes photographs of the Cue Club owned by Duke Vin\u2019s rival Count Suckle. Photographs by Dennis Morris of sound systems in the 1970s were also acquired. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",

But by the 1950\u2019s they had grown to purpose built speakers the size of wardrobes that could be heard many blocks away. The larger these systems the better. Record producer Bunny \u2018Striker\u2019 Lee would remember from the time \u201csound system was like our radio station\u2026not many people on the island would own a wireless, so it was the way for the people to hear their music\u201d. These \u2018House of Joys\u2019 as they were affectionately known were run by the likes of Tom the Great Sebastian who would have people like the legendary Duke Vin [who would go on to be the first system operator in England when he emigrated 3 years later] spinning his tunes.\" - Unknown source",
