They enjoyed great popularity throughout Europe between the 15th century and the mid-17th century. Few casting bottles survive today. They were made redundant by the development of musk- and resin-based perfumes, which required larger bottles.\n\nSocial Class\nThese bottles were frequently given as gifts, notably in the New Year exchanges at the Tudor and Stuart courts. In 1513, Henry VIII gave five away, but by 1524 he had acquired another five. They are among the most luxurious items of Tudor and Stuart metalworking, usually made of precious materials and richly decorated. Rock crystal is a colourless quartz that was valued for its transparency and beauty.  It was highly prized and used for high-status gifts. \n\nDesign & Designing\nCasting bottles were the accessories of the wealthiest and most fashionable members of society. As such, they often follow European fashions more closely than other items. The shape of the bottle was usually that of a flagon, in which wine was served at table.",
