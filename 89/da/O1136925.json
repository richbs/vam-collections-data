The text is as follows: ROME: mid 16th century 484 Design for a pentagonal chapel with a semidome Inscribed on the back in ink in a later hand \u2018F. Zuccaro\u2019 Pen and ink and wash 14 \u00bc x 11 \u00bc (361 x 286) Dyce 197 PROVENANCE Dyce Bequest 1869 LITERATURE <i>Dyce Catalogue</i> no. 197 (as by Federico Zuccaro); J. A. Gere \u2018The Lawerence-Phillipps-Rosenbach Zuccaro Album\u2019 in Master Drawings, 8, 1970, p. 137 The arms over the left door are those of Pope Pius V (Ghislieri), who reigned 1566-72. The shield over the right door is blank and surmounted by a mitre and two crosiers. The saints in the niches above the doors are Peter and Paul. The figures in the spandrels of the arch are evidently prophets, each receiving a message from an angel. The picture on the left wall of the chapel shows the Flight into Egypt. The right hand picture probably represents the angel warning Jospeh to flee. The picture over the altar is of man blessing. The painting in the semidome shows six kneeling angels worshipping God and the Holy Ghost. The drawing was formerly attributed to Frederico Zuccaro, but wrongly. Another version of the upper part of the design, ahowing the semidome and the spandrels, is in the Albertine, Vienna, also wrongly ascribed to Federico (inv. No. 608; Albertina Catalogue, 3, no. 260). Philip Pouncey has discovered other drawings by the same hand, notably: (1) in the British Museum, 4 drawings of the Four Evangelists in niches, writing on tables inscribed in a later hand \u2018Cesare Nebbia\u2019 (inv. Nos. 5227. 35 to 38); (2) in the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung, Munich, a drawing showing the Descent of the Holy Spirit, inscribed in an old hand \u2018Marco da Sena\u2019 (ie Marco Pino: inv. No. 2278). At one time it seemed that a design for the painting of the dome of St Peter\u2019s belonged to the same group (Louvre 2980). But this proposition is open to doubt, and the drawing itself is a puzzle. It is taditionally ascribed to Cesare d\u2019Arpino, who did indeed paint the done, following a scheme much like that shown in the drawing. But the hand is so unlike his as known at present that it is natural to wonder whether the drawing might not be by his predecessor Cristofano Roncalli, who, according to Baglione, was commissioned to Paint the dome by Sixtus V (1585-90) and was superseses by d\u2019Arpino under Clement VII (1592-1605). Gere has suggested that a drawing of the Flagellation in the Zuccaro album\u2019 in the Rosenbach Foundation, Philadephia, might be added to the drawings ascribed to \u2018the Master of Ghislieri Apse\u2019, provisionally listing it under the name of Roncalli (op. cit., pp. 137-38, no. 38, pl. 22).",
