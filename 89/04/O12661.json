His heroism and strong character continues to be recounted through the Chinese historical classic Romance of the Three Kingdoms. He is venerated as a deity in Chinese tradition because of his characteristic uprightness. \n\nThe title Guan Di literally means 'The Emperor Guan\"; on this robe we see symbols from the twelve insignia used by royalty (such as the symmetrical fu symbol in the centre of the robe; millet; flames; mountains; axes and pheasants), underscoring the importance of Guan Di in traditional Chinese beliefs.Since he was considered to be equal to an emperor, it is woven with many of the symbols seen on the emperor\u2019s yellow clothes of the same period. \n\nThis robe would have been one of a set of clothes of different colours made for the same statue, to be changed according to seasons.",
