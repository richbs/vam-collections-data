The image is taken from a photography by Ray Stevenson of a small ripped up souvenir flag, blown up and screen printed by Reid. The misuse of the nation's flag for the artwork of their first single shows the group's early confidence and ambition .\n\nJamie Reid's cut-and-paste aesthetic, as seen on this poster, developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, who would later become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
