It is mainly made of walnut with other woods inlaid.  The carved decoration, for example on the cupboard doors, is in the Reformed Gothic style which was popular in the second half of the nineteenth century.  This involved taking motifs more commonly carved in church stonework and woodwork, and applying them to wooden furniture.  \n\nThe cabinet is also decorated with six enamel plaques depicting different birds.  These are arranged in groups of three either side of a central image in metal of the \u2018Sleeping Beauty\u2019 based on Alfred Tennyson's poem The Day Dream.\n\nTalbert was a Scotsman who originally trained as a carver before working as an architectural draughtsman in Glasgow. He subsequently became a prolific commercial designer of furniture, metalwork, stained glass, wallpapers, textiles and carpets.  He also produced several influential publications including Gothic Forms applied to Furniture Metalwork and Decoration for Domestic Purposes which had a big impact on the way in which the revived Gothic style was used in domestic design.",

The cabinet was described as 'An inlaid walnut wood Cabinet suited for Gothic furnishing - relieved by enamelled discs and subjects in silver deposit modelled from Tennyson's Day-dream.' The next item was 'A chair in same character with stuffed seat covered in velvet.' Figures in the column 'sell for' suggst that the cabinet was priced at \u00a3200 and the chair at \u00a38 10s. Annotations at the end of the Paris 1867 list indicate that the firm valued the cabinet at \u00a3100 and the chair at \u00a34 10s.",
