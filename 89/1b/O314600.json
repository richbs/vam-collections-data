He made several visits to London, the first in 1871. \n\nHenry James Turner (1831-1924) was a successful industrialist, of the second generation of principals in an old-established paint and varnish manufacturing  business, Charles Turner & Son, Ltd. He formed a large collection of oil paintings and drawings by British and continental 19th century artists as well as of sculpture, including other works by Carpeaux.\n\nAccording to his descendants, he commissioned this bust in 1871, along with one of his wife, when he came to London during the unrest of the Paris Commune. The marble bust of Mrs Turner (A.19-1984) is dated 1871. The date of 1873 on the bust of Mr. Turner indicates that it was completed two years later when Carpeaux was in London again, partly to visit the exiled Emperor Napoleon III of whom he completed an official imperial portrait that year (A.43-1983). \n\nThe original plaster of this bust was in the sale of Carpeaux's studio at the Galerie Manzi in Paris, 30 May 1913.",
