This design was made for the pantomime, Aladdin, at the London Palladium, 22 December 1970. The production was directed by Albert J. Knight. Cilla Black played Aladdin.\n\nHistorical significance: An example of pantomime costume design of the second half of the 20th century and of the work of a designer who specialised in pantomime and variety design.  It is also an example of a pantomime costume for a principal boy and illustrates a feature of pantomime of  the 20th century: the employment of stars of popular music, entertainment and television in leading roles, rather than established actors.",
