We know from contemporary illustrations that jars of this size and shape were used by pharmacists to store drugs on shelves in their premises.\n\nThe decoration of large leaves around the centre of this jar is heavily carved through the slip coating. This reveals a great deal of the clay body underneath. On this jar, the carved slip design has been painted with copper-green to contrast with the clay body.\n\nPotters in northern Italy combined fine incising with heavy carving to produce a distinctive foreground and background. In this they were inspired by Middle Eastern designs. Sgraffito is an Italian word meaning 'scratched'. It refers to the technique of scratching through an upper layer of one material to reveal a ground of different colour beneath.",
