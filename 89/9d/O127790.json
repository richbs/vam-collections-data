            "public_access_description": "In 1944, designer Oliver Messel was released from his war duties in camouflage to work on the film Caesar and Cleopatra, adapted from George Bernard Shaw's play.   Messel was responsible for the costumes and the interior design of the sets, bringing all his imagination and ingenuity to creating Roman and Egyptian costumes and interiors in the context of the mid 1940s. The film was the most expensive British film to date, costing over \u00a31m, and brought a welcome sense of extravagance and colour into a drab post-war world.  Surprisingly, given his sense of colour, he never worked on another colour film. \n\nWartime shortages of materials was no problem for Messel, who knew that in theatre and on film, an accurate depiction of reality was not required.  He had always been creative in his use of unexpected materials, and to make this wreath needed no 'real' gold metal or chased decoration.  The leaves are stiffened paper,  with wire stems which are fixed onto a wire circlet bound with brown paper tape, the whole painted to simulate gold or bronzed metal. \n\nVivien Leigh (1913-1967) played Cleopatra.  On the design Messel has indicated the style of make-up for her to use, ensuring the correct overall look for the costume.  Although a costume design is created to indicate the character the actor is playing, it is rare for a designer to indicate the make-up.  Here, Messel has concentrated on the heavy eye-make-up which immediately suggests 'Egyptian' to the audience.  \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  His lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel's style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas. \n\nVivien Leigh (1913-1967) played Cleopatra.  Messel made the jewelled head-dress himself.  He sketched in the facial features of Cleopatra, including the heavily kohl eye makeup, so that the final effect of the design can be more readily imagined.",
