This design was made for the pantomime, Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp, at the London Palladium, 22 December 1964. The production was directed by Albert J. Knight. Cliff Richard played Aladdin, with Una Stubbs as Princess Balroubadour.\n\nHistorical significance: An example of pantomime costume design of the second half of the 20th century and of the work of a designer who specialised in pantomime and variety design.  It is also an example of a pantomime costume for a principal boy and illustrates a feature of pantomime of  the 20th century: the employment of stars of popular music, entertainment and television in leading roles, rather than established actors.",
