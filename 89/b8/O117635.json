NB.  There may be additional concealed wefts.  The good condition of the carpet precludes further investigation.  There are 14 rows of knots per inch (53 per dm).\n\nPILE: wool; 12 colours: dark red, red, dark yellow, yellow, light yellow, dark green, dark blue, blue, light blue, pink, light brown, white; asymmetrical knot open to the right and tied around 2 warp threads; 210 knots per sq. inch (3048 [average] per sq. dm).\n\nSIDE FINISH: one cord oversewn with blue wool.\n\nEND FINISH: Lower: narrow band of plain weave with 2 parallel cotton threads per shoot ending in a row of twining around 4 warp threads to secure 3.5 cms. fringe.  From fringe to pile are 2 rows of weft wrapping in green and dark red.  Upper: as lower.\n\nDESIGN: Field: dark blue ground with floral design mirrored horizontally and vertically.  The eight-petalled central flower with vertical bar appears to extend along the cardinal points to four stylised blue lilies and diagonally to four even larger red ones.  The space between is filled by eight stems bearing small, naturalistic flowers, the whole having the appearance of a floral medallion.  From the pair of blue floral forms in each corner that point diagonally into the centre come a pair of curved stems with multi-coloured flowers, leaves and, at all eight ends, a cluster of three boteh-like red flowers.\n\nMain border: blue ground with long stems bearing large stylised flowers and part flowers, with smaller pendant flowers and with sprigs of six or seven small flowers.  The blossoms are mainly in reds and dark yellow.\n\nInner and outer borders: red ground with a small floral meander largely in dark blue.",
