His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nAnatole de Grunwald commissioned Messel to design costumes and sets for a film version of Alexander Pushkin\u2019s supernatural short story The Queen of Spades in 1949.   Post war rationing meant that materials were difficult to acquire, and Messel made inventive use of unusual materials to create the eerie atmosphere of the Countess\u2019s  Baroque palace in early nineteenth century St. Petersburg.\n\nPart of the charm of the film is the contrast between the extravagant lifestyle of the aristocracy and gritty Russian street life, such as this bird market scene, roughly sketched in ink and wash.",
