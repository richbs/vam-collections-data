In 1807 he entered the RA schools, and exhibited his first painting there. Made his name with 'The Disposal of a Favourite Lamb' in 1813; elected ARA 1814, RA 1820. Achieved great popularity with his landscapes and, particularly, rustic genre scenes in the 1820s; Ruskin highly praised his works in the 1840s. Married in 1822 the sister of the portrait painter Margaret Carpenter. Travelled extensively in Britain and abroad, especially in Italy 1836-38; these visits are reflected in the subjects he painted. Exhibited 124 works at the RA between 1807 and 1846, and 45 at the BI 1808-43. Librarian at the RA 1840-2. Died London 17 February 1847. His studio sale was at Christie's 31 May-5 June 1847. His two sons were the novelist William Wilkie Collins and the painter Charles Allston Collins. There are watercolours and a sketchbook in the V&A collections. \n\nLIT: \tWilliam Collins 'List of Pictures and Patrons', two MS volumes 1808-27 and 1827-46, National Art Library, V&A (referred to below as Lists); <i>Athenaeum</i> 20 February 1847, p200 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i> 1847, p137 (obit); W Wilkie Collins <i>Memoirs of the Life of William Collins, Esq</i>, RA 2 vols, 1848 (referred to below as <i>Memoirs</i>); <i>Art Journal</i> 1855, p 141 W.

The replica appears in Collins Lists among work done between April 1943 and April 1844, as painted for Sheepshanks for \u00a373 10s. \n\nCollins stayed in Sorrento from April to July 1837 to escape the cholera epidemic in Naples. Several paintings resulted from the studies made there during the years after his return to London in 1838. Wilkie Collins (<i>Memoirs</i>, p108) declares that \n\nIf he set forth to study the coast, he could descend to the beach from the cliff on which his house stood, through the winding caverns consecrated by Ulysses to the Syrens, and, arrived at the sea, could look one way towards the noble promontory of MASSA, the ancient dominion of the Syren Queens, and could see in the other direction the clear outline of the classic VESUVIUS, ever crowned, even on fairest days, with its twin volcanic cloud of white smoke. \n\nHe goes on to describe two large sketches with 'the appearance of finished pictures'; for the first, see 'Sorrento - Bay of Naples\u2019, below, while the second \n\nLooks towards Vesuvius also, but from a different point. Here the smooth limpid sea, with gay market-boats floating idly on its surface, ripples into the foreground, tinged with the clear Italian reflections of the hour and scene. A strip of beach, an extremity of rocky cliff, and the point of VICO, presented the rest of the composition in Nature, and supply it in the sketch. The airy delicacy and daylight of the effect thus produced proved so popular in England, that the painter was commissioned to paint two pictures from it. The original study, (for which many offers have been made), remains ... a treasured heirloom in the family of the painter. \n\nThis treasured original study was presumably lot 775, the mounted oil sketch 'Cave of Ulysses, Sorrento', in the artist's posthumous sale at Christie's 5 June 1847. Wilkie Collins (<i>Memoirs</i>, p190) describes the 1841 exhibited painting as 'a copy, on a large scale, of the sketch'. \n\nSorrento, on the south side of the Bay of Naples, is where the Greek hero Ulysses encountered the Sirens; to avoid the fatal lure of their song, he had himself lashed to his ship's mast and his crew's ears plugged with wax. The story is most famously told in book 12 of Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>. The caves of the Sirens (properly called) are still a tourist attraction. \n\nThe Redgraves, while describing the picture as 'a work of great truth and beauty', express doubts on whether Collins forsaking English for Italian scenes was of benefit to his reputation, and add that over-exposure to the sun while painting at Sorrento caused the illness that eventually led to his death. \n\nEXH: <i>Victorian Painting</i> Arts Council 1962 (9) \n\nLIT: <i>Lists</i>; <i>Memoirs</i> II, pp108-9, 190-1; Redgrave <i>Cent</i>, p417\"",
