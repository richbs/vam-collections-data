Potter purchased her first holding of Hill Top farm and farmhouse in 1905 partly from the income generated by the first few of her very popular 'little books'. She went on to acquire over 4,300 acres of fields, farms, cottages, and woodland in the Lake District which formed the Heelis Bequest to the National Trust after her death in 1943.\n\nAlthough not the variety depicted here, Potter became increasingly interested in preservation of the Herdwick variety of sheep \u2013 a breed, uniquely suited to the Lake District\u2019s rocky terrain \u2013 which was becoming endangered. She reared her own flocks, became a member of the Herdwick Sheep Breeder\u2019s Association and won many prizes for her ewes in the local shows. \n\nBeatrix Potter is one of the world's best-loved children's authors and illustrators. She wrote the majority of the twenty-three original Peter Rabbit books between 1901 and 1913. The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.",
