This image is part of a body of work in which they harnessed their camera to a moving structure, such as a telescope. For 'Circling off Ramsgate' they selected a boat to map out the picture. The original digital image was produced in a computer, from a sequence of still pictures recorded by a digital video ('DV') camera. The boat was turned in a circle near the buoy, which they had planned in advance. The entire sequence was recorded over a period of about one minute. The waves, wind and tide pushed and pulled the boat. It was also raining.",
