The figure which forms the finial of the cover is a Bacchante, a follower of Bacchus, the god of wine. The cup and cover belonged to the collection of William Beckford (1760-1844) of Fonthill Abbey.  Beckford accumulated an extensive and important collection, including many works by the goldsmith James Aldridge. This object may have been made by Aldridge or by John Harris.\n\nThe 18th century saw an emerging class of rich citizens who used their acquired wealth to indulge a passion for beautiful objects. The Renaissance tradition of the treasury or Schatzkammer, a special room for displaying exotic artefacts, continued in the 18th and 19th centuries. Other types of display included presentation plate, often of solid gold, which in the 18th century was worth about twenty times the value of silver.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde a formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
