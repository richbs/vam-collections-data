He wears a girded habit under a cloak with a lappet hanging down in front; on his shoulders he wears a hood, gathered in folds round his neck. In his right hand he carries a closed book, and in his left he holds the handle of a spade which rests between his feet. \n\nA horizontal break across the middle of the figure has been repaired. The bottom left-hand corner of the figure and part of the saint's beard is missing. The top of his book is chipped. The lower right-hand side of the figure has been damaged.\n\nNo paint remains on the figure. The back of the figure bears three holes, two of which are lead-plugged.",

He is the patron saint of gardeners. \n\nSaints are the heroes and heroines of Christian faith. In the 14th and 15th centuries, they were a popular subject for alabaster carvings. Religious themes penetrated private life, so devotional images of saints were sculpted not only for church interiors, but also for individuals to contemplate within the privacy of their homes.",
