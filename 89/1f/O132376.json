Jan van den Hecke (1620-1684) worked primarily in Antwerp, though he also made trips to Italy and Brussels. In Antwerp van de Hecke appears to have been greatly influenced by the style of Jan Davidsz de Heem who had settled there by 1636.In his Teutsche Academie published in 1675, Joachim von Sandrart, a contemporary of de Heem, reports that the artist moved to Antwerp because, 'there one can have the rare fruits including all manner of large plums, peaches, apricots, sour oranges, lemons, grapes, and other, in better quality and ripeness, (so as to) to reproduce them from life'. This painting displays rare and precious food items which often intended to Christian values: cherries for example are considered a fruit of Paradise, while grapes symbolize redemption. De Heem had a great influence on the development of Netherlandish painting during the 17th century, especially his large sumptuous still-lifes of the 1640s made a profound impression and many painters tried to imitate his work. His influence was strongest in Utrecht, Leyden and Antwerp where he had many followers. He was highly admired by his contemporaries and is still praised as one of the greatest still-life painters. Jan van den Hecke here uses the blond tonalities and protruding vine both signatures of van Heem and his followers' works. A similar broken branch protruding from the central composition is visible for example in Fruits and pieces of seafood  of 1659 now in the Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier. Although the muddy brown-grey background appears hastily painted, there was evidently careful attention given to details such as the misty bloom on the grapes and the broken branch and curling vine at lower right.",

Similar fruit pieces have been attributed to Cuyp (Von Hangel sale, Moos, Geneva, 25 May 1935, lot 35, repr.; Smulders sale, M\u00fcller, Amsterdam, 26 June 1934, lot 61, repr.), but in fact authenticated still-life pictures by Cuyp are very uncommon. Many of those bearing his name are now attributed to his follower Abraham van Calraet (1642-1722) but 1369-1869 does not fit with Calraet's known work either. However, it appears to be a genuine painting of the latter part of the 17th century, to which the signature has been added at a later date. \n\n<i>Condition.</i>Damaged lower right corner and upper left background; paint surface worn in the middle area. \n<i>Prov.</i>The Rev.

Victoria & Albert Museum, HMSO, London, 1990.  p.xix.\n\n'Chauncy Hare Townshend  (1798-1868)  was born into a wealthy family, only son of Henry Hare Townsend of Busbridge Hall, Godalming, Surrey.  Educated at Eton and Trinity Hall, Cambridge (BA 1821).  Succeeded to the family estates 1827, when he added 'h' to the Townsend name.  He had taken holy orders, but while he always referred to himself as 'Rev.' on the title pages of his books, he never practised his vocation... . Very much a dilettante in the eighteenth-century sense, he moved in the highest social and literary circles; a great friend of Charles Dickens (he was the dedicatee of <u>Great Expectations</u>) with whom he shared a fascination of mesmerism...  Bulwer Lytton described his life's 'Beau-deal of happiness' as 'elegant rest, travel, lots of money - and he is always ill and melancholy'.  Of the many watercolours and British and continental oil paintings he bequeathed to the V&A, the majority are landscapes.  He is the first identifiable British collector of early photographs apart from the Prince Consort, particularly landscape photography, and also collected gems and geological specimens.'\n\nHistorical significance: This painting has been attributed, based on photographs only, to Jan van den Hecke by Dr. Fred Meijer (verbal communication) in February 2010. van den Hecke (1620-1684) worked primarily in Antwerp, though he also made trips to Italy and Brussels. In Antwerp van de Hecke appears to have been greatly influenced by the style of Jan Davidsz de Heem who had settled there by 1636.In his <i>Teutsche Academie</i> published in 1675, Joachim von Sandrart, a contemporary of de Heem, reports that the artist moved to Antwerp because, 'there one can have the rare fruits including all manner of large plums, peaches, apricots, sour oranges, lemons, grapes, and other, in better quality and ripeness, (so as to) to reproduce them from life'. This painting displays rare and precious food items which often intended to Christian values: cherries for example are considered a fruit of Paradise, while grapes symbolize redemption. De Heem had a great influence on the development of Netherlandish painting during the 17th century, especially his large sumptuous still-lifes of the 1640s made a profound impression and many painters tried to imitate his work. His influence was strongest in Utrecht, Leyden and Antwerp where he had many followers. He was highly admired by his contemporaries and is still praised as one of the greatest still-life painters. Jan van den Hecke here uses the blond tonalities and protruding vine both signatures of van Heem and his followers' works. A similar broken branch protruding from the central composition is visible for example in <i>Fruits and pieces of seafood </i> of 1659 now in the Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier. Although the muddy brown-grey background appears hastily painted, there was evidently careful attention given to details such as the misty bloom on the grapes and the broken branch and curling vine at lower right.",

            "historical_context_note": "Flower and fruit still lifes. The flowers painted in most 17th century still lifes were items of considerable luxury and prestige.  The flowers were in bloom for only a short time.  The flowers we see depict in early flower pieces, however, did not all bloom in the same season, demonstrating that these were compositions made from studies executed when the flowers were in bloom.  The flowers painted in early still lifes were mostly exotic ones that were imported as bulbs. Often the vases in which the flowers were displayed were also luxury items. Around mid century ornamented silver vases are included, followed by bronze, stone and terracotta vessels in the 18th century and vases of cut crystal in the 19th. Flower still lifes derive in part from the symbolic role of flowers in religious paintings. Also flowers were transiency symbols because they only bloom for a short time and hence refer to themes of Vanity and Pride and the transiency of luxury articles. \nFruit pieces developed naturally from early 17th century still lifes depicting meals, in which fruit always played an important role.  Fruit pieces flourished after the debacle of the tulip trade around 1640.  The impulses came partly from Antwerp, where Jan Davidsz. De Heem had settled in 1635. De Heem had developed a technique that was more painterly than the usual smooth glazing techniques of his predecessors, reflecting the influence of the freer brush strokes of Jacob Van Es and Frans Snyders. De Heem combined various different painting styles in one painting using both broad brush strokes and minutely elaborated ones. In contrast, artists such as Abraham van Beyeren from The Hague painted in more fluid style.",
