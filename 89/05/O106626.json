They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector\u2019s pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical purposes. They also inspired designs in other media, from architecture to bookbindings. This plaquette is based on a Renaissance cameo though it appears in a number of variants. It shows Phaeton, son of Helios, the sun god. Phaeton\u2019s attempt to drive his father\u2019s chariot ended in disaster when he set fire to the earth and tumbled into the River Po.",
