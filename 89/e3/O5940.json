This common form also had the advantage that pieces from different sets could easily be mixed together on a pyramid of graduated salvers.\n\nRetailers & Traders\nBy the second half of the 18th century, the number of 'chinamen' (retailers of porcelain, pottery and glass) had greatly increased to cater for fashionable new table settings. Many types of dessert glasses are shown in their trade cards, generally falling into the categories of tall or squat, and cut or mould-blown.\n\nDesign & Designing\nAlthough this mould-blown example would have been much cheaper than cut glass, it echoes the styles of cut glass with its lobed foot and diamond-mesh pattern. Possibly due to the lack of suitably patterned dip-mould, this piece has been mould-blown with vertical ribs which have been pinched together while still molten - an outmoded and labour-intensive technique dating back to George Ravenscroft's Italian glassmakers of the 1670s.",
