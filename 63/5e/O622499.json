This series of ten pendant designs by Collaert was published first by Hans I Liefrinck before 1573 and later by Theodoor Galle, after Collaert\u2019s death. The ten pendants in this collection are accompanied by designs for buttons or earrings and set against a grey background. Five of the pendants contain a mythological figure in a niche. With the exception of the title plate, the ones that lack these figures are probably verso designs for similar pendants, though no two outlines in the suite are the same. The jewellery that would result from these designs was probably meant to be gold with bright enamel paint on the intricate design work and the figures that appear in the niches. In similar jewellery, the arabesque ornamentation around the figures was usually open and the figures themselves three dimensional.",
