Brown ground divided into an horizontally stretched oval lattice formed by red feathery leaves.  There is a round blossom where the leaves meet.  Each segment contains a rosette in the centre with a spray of leaves and flowers to either side. Everything is worked in yellow silk which originally was covered with silk strip.  Details are in red silk.  The round blossoms where the lines meet were coloured to form diagonal lines of light blue, white or mauve.  The white silk was originally covered with silver strip. The integral border has a yellow ground [metal thread] with a fine brown meander with red, blue, light blue and mauve flowers and small white ones.  There is a reciprocal diamond-head border either side.\nThe added border on the right hand side is bias-cut; striped pattern with a pair of light blue stripes with off-set vertical floral sprigs in pink and green outlined with metal thread [silver strip S-wound on yellow silk] alternating with a wider stripe with a metal thread ground and a large upright pink rose with small blue flower heads. This pattern is similar to other fabric in the Collection eg. T.121-1926.",
