At the 1924 Empire Exhibition he had seen Morris's 'Daisy' wallpaper and was inspired by its simple charm to begin making his own wallpapers. His former teacher Paul Nash described him 'obscurely printing a series of very original wallpaper designs cut on linoleum'. Between 1926 and 1929 these linocut prints were reproduced by the Curwen Press on a commercial scale using lithography. This was itself an unusual process for printing wallpaper, but allowed them to preserve the characteristic uneven texture of the original linocuts.\n\nThough they received favourable publicity, Bawden's papers were perhaps too assertive and individual for the average home, and sales were uneven.\n\n[Gill Saunders, 'British Design at Home', p.111]",
