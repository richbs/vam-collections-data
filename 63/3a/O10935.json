Sconces may have developed from the habit of fixing a reflecting plate of brass or copper behind a candle to increase the light it gave. Metal was a favourite material for lighting since it was not flammable and gave a pleasant reflection. Only the wealthy could afford silver for lighting.\n\nEach of the branches has a grease pan to avoid the tallow or candle wax from dripping onto people's heads. The brass nuts that hold the branches are modern replacements so it is possible that the sconce originally held only one candle but was later adapted for two.\n\nPeople\nThis sconce is engraved with the arms of William Herbert, 2nd Marquess of Powis (1667-1745) . It is surmounted by a Duke's coronet with a leopard to one side and a lion to the other. This refers to William Herbert's father, who was created Duke of Powis and Marquess of Montgomery by James II (1633-1701), after the King was expelled from Britain in 1688 in favour of William and Mary.\n\nJohn Bodington registered a hallmark as a silversmith in 1697 and worked until his death in  January 1727. His surviving work is of high quality. It was influenced by the work of Huguenot silversmiths working in London  in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.\n\nPlace\nThese sconces were formerly in the Blue Drawing Room of Powis Castle, Welshpool, Wales. There is a companion pair are in the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff.",
