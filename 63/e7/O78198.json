It has been mounted onto a page with three other designs, two of which have a similar overall design based around a diagonal division.\n\nPeople\nThese designs for tiles were prepared by Godwin & Co for the architect Sir George Gilbert Scott (1811-1878), who undertook the restoration of Salisbury Cathedral.  When Scott was working on the refurbishment of churches he had the patterns reproduced from existing tiles. Sometimes they were in the same size as the original, but often they were reduced to enable them to fit with other patterns and sizes of tiles.\n\nDesign & Designing\nFrom about 1830 Medieval Gothic styles were adopted by designers for the architecture and furnishings of new and refurbished churches.  Designs for tiles were copied, traced or adapted from old examples in, or designed specifically for use in the restoration of, various buildings.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe heraldic bird motif was copied from original examples of Medieval tiles known to have been used in Salisbury Cathedral and Christchurch Priory from about 1280. Heraldic animal figures, like the bird here, were popular motifs in medieval Gothic and Gothic revival designs.",
