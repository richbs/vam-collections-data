E.1208-1988. \nThe Crass collective\u2019s multi-media promotion of personal expression and autonomy found favour with a large sector of Britain\u2019s youth in the late 1970s and early \u201880s rejecting the escapism of \u2018pop\u2019 and the clich\u00e9d pleasures of rock. With a late 1960s bias towards self-generated messages and imagery of near-tribal significance, Crass welded together disparate social comments with intentionally abrasive sounds and pictures. The graphic messages of Crass appeared on walls as often as on sleeves and were there to \u2018sell\u2019 an alternative system of attitudes and offer a binding ritual focus. Crass Records encouraged young groups to submit their own music and graphics for pressing, printing and release. The material received was issued as two compilation LPs.\u2019",

The collectives' ethos was one of honesty and self-approval. Their music lyrics and imagery were conceived to shock audiences into evaluating their respective beliefs and feelings. Crass aesthetics and values found favour with a section of British youth in the late 1970s and 1980s and many faithfully imitated them in their clothing, music and graphics. The Crass collective's multi-media promotion of personal expression and autonomy rejected the escapism of 'pop' and the clich\u00e9d pleasures of rock. With a late 1960s bias towards self-generated messages and imagery of near-tribal significance, Crass welded together disparate social comments with intentionally abrasive sounds and pictures. The graphic messages of Crass appeared on walls as often as on sleeves and were there to 'sell' an alternative system of attitudes and offer a binding ritual focus. Crass Records encouraged young groups to submit their own music and graphics for pressing, printing and release. The material received was issued as two compilation LPs.",
