The Haslemere Peasant Industries was a community of artist craftspeople which was set up in Surrey in 1894 in an effort to obtain 'the double pleasure of lovely surroundings and happy work'.  Ironwork, pottery, woodwork, fresco painting, hand-press printing, bookbinding, plasterwork and carving were all produced, but textiles were by far their most important crafts.  \n\nThe first weaving sheds were set up by Joseph and Maud King who specialised in hand woven, plain and figured materials in linen, silk and cotton.  From 1896 applique\u201a embroideries, such as this example, were produced by the Peasant Arts Society founded by Godfrey Blount and his wife Ethel Hine. Local women were recruited for the workshops and trained in weaving and embroidery techniques. \n\nGodfrey Blount had trained as a painter at the Slade School in London. He was keen to develop the rural ideal of Arts and Crafts philosophy and concentrated on the design of embroideries and hand-woven pile carpets also made by the Society. His designs for embroidered hangings use the simple but very effective technique of linen on linen with linear embroidery in linen thread. Peasant tapestries were designed for a number of different domestic purposes, including portisres, casement curtains and bed hangings. They became very fashionable in artistic circles and were sold through various shops.  Heal's exhibited a set of bed hangings at the Paris Exhibition of 1900.",
