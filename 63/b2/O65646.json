As on this gourd-shaped vase, motifs included figurative scenes from well-known novels and legends. The base of the vase bears the Qing dynasty reign mark of the Kangxi emperor (1662-1722). Porcelains of the Kangxi period are renowned for their clear colours and painterly decoration. Medium-sized jars and bowls were typically decorated with garden scenes depicting scholars, women and children at leisure.\n\nTime\nDuring the 14th century cobalt was imported into China from the Middle East, especially Iran. By the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), however, methods of processing local Chinese cobalt ores had been developed. Blue and white porcelain was exported in large quantities to the Middle East and to a lesser extent to the West.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe Jingdezhen kilns in Jiangxi Province have produced most of China's porcelain for more than a thousand years. Much of the production has been of blue and white wares. The cobalt blue pigment was painted directly onto the porcelain body, which was then covered with a clear glaze and fired to a temperature of between 1280 and 1350 degrees Celcius.",
