            "physical_description": "This wooden Angel Gabriel stands with his left hand to his chest, holding the end of his cloak.  His head, at a slight angle to his body, would have faced a pendant Virgin Mary.  The original wings have been lost. Until 1939 he was displayed with the nineteenth-century replacement wings.  These were removed and are now held in storage.  The appearance of the original wings is unclear, as almost all similar wooden Gabriel sculptures have lost their wings.  They may have been large wooden pieces resembling  birds' wings, if contemporary paintings depicting are indications.  The original holes for the wings are visible at the back and reveal that this Gabriel, like other contemporary wooden sculpture was hollowed out.\n\nThe sculpture has been damaged by worm and excessive restoration.  Much of the original polychrome has been lost, though traces of the pattern that once covered his cloak remain in the lower folds.  The right hand, raised in a blessing gesture, is a later restoration,  as are parts of the right shoulder. The crown of the head, which is heavily damaged by worm and has a much broader curl pattern than the lower half, is also likely to be a later addition to the sculpture. Contaminated wood was sometimes used by forgers in order to give the appearance of age to their work. (Newbery, Bisacca and Kanter, 103).  \n.",

            "history_note": "The angel formed part of a group representing the Annunciation, but the Virgin has been lost. The angel is stylistically related to the marble Annunciation group by Nino Pisano in Santa Caterina, Pisa, which is signed and dated 1370, but there is no authenticated work by Nino in wood.\nLike other wooden statuary of its time, it would have been brightly painted with different colors and had gilded hair. Restoration in 1959 revealed traces of the original paint pattern on the robe.  The pattern would have been similar to those found on textile fragments from Lucca (a major silk weaving center from the thirteenth century) held in the V&A; such as the fragment numbered T66-1910.\n\nHistorical significance: The scene of the Annunciation, when Gabriel informed the Virgin Mary that she would give birth to the Christ Child, was very popular in Italy during the thirteenth century and was depicted in paint, in sculpture and in religious theatre. Wooden sculptures in particular were known to have been used in processions due to their lightness and portability.\n[Statue] Purchased in Florence by John Charles Robinson, who did not record the name of the dealer. Robinson claimed that the dealer told him the angel came from an Annunciatory pair in Pisa cathedral, and had recently been displayed there on a bracket at a substantial height.  The dealer related that the pair had been removed from the church and sold to a priest who took them to his country church.  The priest then cut off the base and part of the lower drapery of the Virgin in order to have the sculpture fit into a niche.  The priest  tried to modify the angel sculpture into a Virgin, but proved unsuccessful.  He then sold the angel to the dealer. However, there is no documentary proof of this.\n\nThe sculpture was restored in 1959.  The restorer, K. F. Hemple noted that upon examination he  found five different layers of paint, along with traces of gilding in the hair.  All of the outer layers were removed in order to preserve the remains of the original paint. Certain damaged areas were filled with polyfiller, and the right hand (an addition from a previous restorer) was bleached to match better the tone of the face and left hand. It was also noted that \"considerable retouching\" was undertaken to create a more unified appearance; including filling areas of the right shoulder and the decoration. Robinson had already noted in 1869 that the angel had been \"coarsely repainted.\" (Robinson, 13) \n\nThe original wings were lost, and were replaced by a later pair (possibly nineteenth century), which remained on display until 1939.\n\nHistorical significance: Burresi assigned  the Gabriel  to Nino Pisano and workshop in 1983.  She noted similarities between its style and a Virgin Annunciate from the church of the Santo Crocifisso in Pontedera, near Pisa.  She suggested the V&A Angel was originally partnered with  the Pontedera Virgin, based on Robinson's story that the two sculptures, originally in the Pisa Duomo, were separated and the sculpture of the Virgin cut down. (Burresi, 1983, 190). Her argument was based on similarities in style between the Pontedera Virgin and the V&A Gabriel, as well as the removal of the bottom section of the statue of the Virgin (which correlates with Robinson's story). However, Burresi noted that the proportions of the Virgin together with certain differences in style might indicate that the two works were not in fact paired, and that the angel could date to the late 1370s.  She suggested Tommaso Pisano may have been involved with the carving and execution of the Gabriel along with his brother Nino.\n \nIn 2000, Burresi limited her attribution to Nino, and stated that the Gabriel and the Pontedera Virgin were most likely partners from the same place of origin. (Burresi, 2000, 174)  This contrasts sharply with Burresi's earlier comment that no documentation regarding the Virgin's original location survives. (Burresi, 1983,  185). The suggestion of pairing the two must therefore be only considered as tenuous.  \n\n \nIt is also important to remember that we have only Robinson's word via a dealer that the V&A Angel was ever in the Pisa Duomo, as Pope-Hennessy noted that the Angel does not appear on any inventory of the Duomo that he examined. Pope-Hennessy attributed the work to Nino Pisano and rejected Kreytenberg's assignment of the sculpture to Tommaso Pisano.\nMoskowitz (1986) did not include the Angel in her monograph of Andrea and Nino Pisano, and assigned the Pontedera Virgin to Nino Pisano's workshop with his involvement.  Her exclusion of the sculpture seems to indicate that she would not attribute it to either Pisano brother.\n\nWooden sculptures that have been attributed to the workshop of Nino Pisano, his father Andrea and his brother Tommaso, are found throughout Tuscany and in international museums. These works include other, separated groups of Annunciations, which he and his workshop executed during the second half of the fourteenth century.  The only secure attribution to Nino of an Annunciate group is the marble group formerly in San Zeno in Pisa and now in the church of Santa Caterina. The marble group appears to have been the model for the wooden groups attributed to Nino and his workshop, with varying levels of Nino's involvement. The hair, diadem, smile and pose of the V&A Gabriel share general similarities with the marble Gabriel.  The angle of the Gabriel's neck, the curve of his jaw line, the small, smiling mouth, the position of his left hand and the fall of his drapery along his right side are all similar to such elements found in the Virgin Annunciate at the National Gallery in Washington, D.C.  That Virgin Annunciate is paired with an Angel Gabriel at the National Gallery, both attributed to Nino Pisano by Burresi but currently relegated to the anonymous \"Pisan 14th century\" by the American museum. \n\nThe level of damage and restoration to the V&A angel make a secure attribution difficult. However, similarities with works known to be by Nino, as noted above, suggest at least that it could be attributed to him and/or his workshop.",

            "historical_context_note": "Nino was strained by his father, Andrea Pisano, whom he succeeded as Capomaestro of the cathedral at Orvieto in 1349.\n[Statue] Wood has been favoured by sculptors across cultures since the earliest times for its relative ease in working, variety of textures, prevalence and lightness. However, its organic qualities do not allow for a long survival rate, as it is easily affected by temperature, humidity, and worms. Northern Europeans used oak and walnut, while those in the Mediterranean region used poplar, pine, chestnut, walnut, and limewood due to local growth.\n\nMedieval and Renaissance wood sculptures were often  worked on by more than one artist; as carpenters would prepare the wood, the carver would sculpt it, and a painter would apply the final polychromy. The work was divided in this manner due to expertise and guild restrictions. Preparation of the wood included removing the heartwood and drying out the exterior shell in order to avoid shrinkage and warping. The paint was applied over a layer of gesso and linen cloth, which would disguise any faults in the wood and was the same technique for preparing wooden panels for painting.  On sculpture in the round, linen and gesso could also be used to add realistic drapery to the figure. \n\nWooden sculptures abounded in medieval and Renaissance churches; popular themes included the Deposition, the seated Virgin and Child, and the Annunciation.  Such sculptures were often objects of popular devotion and continually repainted until the nineteenth century, with believers adding jewellery and clothing to the figures, which can still be seen in Catholic churches today.\n\nThe lightness of the hollowed-out wood made it the ideal material for sculptures that were to be used in processions or \"sacre rappresentazioni,\" which became particularly popular after the 1200s. It has also been suggested that the paint rendered the sculptures more lifelike, giving them more resonance for participants standing or kneeling in prayer before the statues or watching them being moved through the streets in  processions. If present day confraternal processions are any indication, the sculptures would have been placed on biers which were then hoisted on the shoulders of men who followed a rocking gait in order to cause the sculpture to sway in a lifelike manner.  The lightness of the hollowed-out wood would have eased the men\u2019s job of carrying the sculpture.  Processions occurred on feast days, and the Feast of the Annunciation (March 25), which the pairings of Gabriel and the Madonna represented, was particularly important in Tuscany as it marked the start of the new year.  The sculptures may also have been taken down in order to be used during plays or in the church during feast days.  Documentary evidence notes that sculptures descended or rose into the altar area through the use of pulleys and machines.  This was especially popular with Gabriel figures, who were sent into churches during celebrations of the Annunciation.\n\nWhereas marble or bronze sculpture was often intended to be observed within one architectural setting, wood sculpture did not suffer the same constraints. (Carletti, Giometti, 37 -39) However, the very portability of wooden sculpture means that the original location intended for the piece can be difficult to trace.  Its lightness makes it easy to transport, while its lesser value than marble made its conservation less likely. Sculptural groups have also been separated, as is the case for the V&A Annunciatory Angel. \n\nNineteenth-century Europe saw an increasing interest in the applied arts. Spalletti noted that in 1800s there was an interest in wooden sculpture because of its possibilities for teaching and influencing contemporary design, and suggests this as the reason for the purchase of the Gabriel.  (Spalletti, 15).\n\nSpalletti highlighted that the acquisition of the Pisano angel and Robinson\u2019s claim to knowledge of its original location in the Duomo was surprising for its time, as not many collectors or museums were interested in wooden sculpture. However, this attention was short-lived and no more Italian wooden sculpture of significance was bought by the museum after this purchase. This may have been due to lack of availability.  Wood deteriorates more easily than stone and is at greater risk during fires, which has likely led to the disappearance of many wooden sculptures.  Furthermore, the sculptures that were retained in churches were often prized for their age and participation in local processions and were not available for sale.",
