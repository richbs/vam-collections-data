            "history_note": "John Richardson, who made this piece, was among the most important goldsmiths in London in the late seventeenth century. Born in Worcester in the early 1640s, he was apprenticed to the prominent London goldsmith Henry Greenway and eventually took over his master's business when Greenway retired in 1670. Richardson enjoyed a successful career: the scale of his activity is reflected in the number of apprentices (four) attached to his workshop, and in the importance of the commissions entrusted to him. These included candlesticks, flagons, a basin and altar cruets for Westminster Abbey, marked for London 1684-85.\nPersonal matters appear to have motivated his return to Worcester in around 1695, and he died there in 1697-98.\nThe porringer was presented to the Museum in 1885 by the Rev. T W Webb.\n\nHistorical significance: Thomas Pengelly the elder was a London Levant merchant and married Rachel Baines; he commissioned this porringer from one of the more prominent London goldsmiths of the period.",
