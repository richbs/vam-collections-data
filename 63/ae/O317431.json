There is an oblong outer case of cream-coloured quilted satin, decorated with wavy stems and rosettes. It has a silk tape for typing. \n\nThe outside is embroidered in purple silk with the following verses: \n'When Judah's daughters, captive led, beheld their mighty kings subdu'd; their holy see-and prophets dead, their santu'ries with blood imbru'd.\nthe exil'd widows, far expell'd, their infant-orphans closely press'd; and while the sickly charge they held, it died upon the mothers breast, \nsuch woes, O Judah, were thy fate, by god's great Judgments overthrown and while their sorrows we relate, we read their suff'rings in our own.\norphans like these no parents care: our early lamp of life supply'd: like them we weep; yet not despair, since god vouchsafes our steps to guide.\nas flow'rets bloom upon a grave, our gratitude from sorrow springs; the incense pure may angels save, and bear it on their balmy wings.\nto him, who from heav'n's highest,  throne beholds his children in destres and claims the orphan for his own, as father of the fatherless.'\n\nAbove are a flowering plant issuing from a two-handled vase, two baskets of fruit, and butterflies; below, a fruit tree with a bird on either side. There is a border all round of a zigzag continuous stem with pink flowers resembling carnations. The inside has four pockets and at the bottom are three pieces of quilted satin for holding needles. There is a similar floral border to the outside round each pocket, and in the middle are worked the following verses in purple silk: \n'Chill'd by the blasts of adverse, fate opress'd by sorrow's gloom, the soothing voice of Parent love all hush'd within the tomb.\nwithout us, want his vigils kept; within us silent woe; our infant minds in fearful thought made ev'ry shade a foe, \ngod' pitying eye our trouble saw, and instantly relief broke through the wintry clouds of woe, and scatter'd ev'ry grief.\nbeneath his heav'nly wings we find a calm and safe retreat: O, then let ev'ry orphan breast with grateful transport beat!'",
