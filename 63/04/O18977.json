These motifs are framed by repeated star-like flower-heads and close-set wavy lines. The bottle was made by the contemporary Korean artist Min Yong-gi (born 1947). In his ceramics Min Yong-gi revives the kind of rustic decoration found on Korean punch'ong wares of the 15th and 16th centuries. These are stonewares of quite coarse, greyish clay decorated with white slip (clay thinned with water) and covered in a pale bluish-green glaze. Punch'ong wares may be characterised by their bold and energetic inlaid designs many of which appear spontaneous and naturalistic. \nMin Yong-gi's interest in punch'ong wares has led him to undertake historical research on the topic and to investigate kiln sites.",
