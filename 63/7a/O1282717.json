Giovanni Battista Belzoni (1778-1823) was born in Padua but came to London with his brother in 1803 where he was engaged by Charles Dibdin Junior for Sadler's Wells Theatre as the Giant in Jack the Giant Killer in which he  performed a strong man act. He went on to be known as 'the Patagonian Sampson' but is better known for his later career as an engineer and Egyptologist.  \n\nAnn Siggs, the London beggar who walked with two crutches, appears to have become famous for her daily perambulations around London from her home in Swallow Street, and for the pride which she took in her appearance. Patrick O\u2019Brien (1760-1806), born Patrick Cotter in Kinsale, Ireland in 1760, grew to the height of over eight foot and became known as the Irish Giant and the Bristol Giant. He was \u2018discovered\u2019 by an agent in Ireland who brought him to England to exhibit him in Bristol in 1782, and by about 1785 came to London where he exhibited himself very profitably at 30 St. James Street. \n\nGeorge Romondo, or Raymondo the Portuguese dwarf mimic, was taken to London in 1800 by an Italian showman who exhibited him at fairgrounds as 'the Little Man of the Mountain', imitating animal noises and playing the French horn, trumpet and drum. Recorded as being three foot six inches tall, he became known in London for his trademark hat, white cotton stockings and red slippers. Daniel Lambert (1770- 1808) known as the most corpulent man of his day, was born in Leicester and found fame in London in 1806 where he exhibited himself in rooms in Piccadilly. He made further appearances in London in 1807 and in the provinces but died in Cambridge in 1809 weighing almost fifty-two stone.",
