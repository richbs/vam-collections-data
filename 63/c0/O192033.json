The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nThe text-based poster reproduces a citation by Oscar Lafontaine, the leader of the West German SPD who campaigned for the East German party as a candidate for Chancellor at the elections. He states: 'Wir wollen das Zusammenwachsen der Deutschen so gestalten, da\u00df soziale Gerechtigkeit garantiert wird. Und die Menschen in der DDR m\u00fcssen Ihre Selbstachtung und W\u00fcrde bewahren k\u00f6nnen.' This means: 'We want to manage the growing together of Germans in a way that guarantees social justice. The people in the GDR must be able to hold on to their self-respect and dignity.'\n\nThe history of the SPD within the German Democratic Republic (GDR) ended in 1948, when it was forced to merge with the KPD (Communist party of Germany) to form the SED ('Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands - 'Socialist Unity Party of Germany'). The SPD was newly established (initially as the SDP) on the 7th of October 1989 - the anniversary of the founding of the GDR. For the election campaign the SPD was supported by its sister party in West Germany. One of the main arguments for voting for the SPD was the fact that the CDU-East (Christian Democratic Union) had been the partner of the SED since 1949 as a satellite party in the form of the National Front. However, the SPD parties did not communicate a determined intention for German reunification \u2013 as the CDU did. This accounted for them losing the absolute majority they aspired to. On 26th of September 1990 SPD-East and SPD-West united.",
