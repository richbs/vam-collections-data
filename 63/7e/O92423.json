He published 'David Bailey's box of pin-ups' in 1965 as a loose portfolio of 36 portraits of the mainly-male fashionable elite that, as the cover description states, 'belong to Bailey's own world of fashion, pop music and the Ad Lib [nightclub]'. Each portrait is accompanied by notes by Francis Wyndham. \nSurprisingly, only four of the pin-ups are women; as the notes explain, 'in the age of Mick Jagger, it is the boys who are the pin-ups'. Jean Shrimpton was one of the most internationally famous models of the decade and worked almost exclusively with Bailey - to whom she was engaged - between 1961 and 1964.\nThe portraits constitute a celebration of the growing celebrity culture of the Sixties, and many of them have become the definitive images of key figures of cultural life in London during the Swinging Sixties.",

The portraits constitute a celebration of the growing celebrity culture, which encompassed the celebrity status of fashionable photographers themselves. The prints were a commercial success. Many of them have become iconic images of key figures of cultural life in 1960s London. This image of the fashion model Jean Shrimpton is a result of Bailey and Shrimpton's partnership during that period, when they worked for Vogue and brought swinging sixties London styles to America.",
