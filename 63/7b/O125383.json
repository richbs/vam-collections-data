Their bases finish with scrolls and crudely modelled breasted women. They are strengthened at the base behind with semi-ogee shaped blocks.\nThe mirror proper contains its original bevelled glass and the bloection frame has bow-shaped corners at the top. It is pivoted on brass screws between the mirror and its supports.\nThe oblong base has canted front corners with scaled consoles, the scrolls enclosing rosettes. There is a drawer in the base complete with lock, key escutcheons and inlayed engraved brass sprigs of acanthus are found at the corners of the drawers. Further acanthus are to be found inlaid into the surface of the top of the base, in the front corners. These have lost most of thei rengraving. This top surface is veneered with banded mahogany.\nOn the sides are rectangular hinged brass handles which lie flush against the sides, and fit into a brass bed.\nThe whole rests on bun feet to the rear and carved scrolled feet enclosing rosettes to the front.\nThe mirror is in the style associated with the Channon workshop.\n\nPacked, so not examined for Materials and Techniques 13/06/06",
