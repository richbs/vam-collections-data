These include squatters, council house tenants and those living in caravans.  This image is representative of his approach to marginal groups.  The two boys and young girl are depicted under a canopy of trees from above with shards of subtle light illuminating their faces to create very intimate portraits.  Hunter has often refered to paintings by the Dutch Old Master Jan Vermeer in his portraits.",
