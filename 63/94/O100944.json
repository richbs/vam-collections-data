Food and fuel shortages, restrictions on free speech and the threat of imprisonment or worse were part of the daily conditions of life. \n\nIn common with many East European artists, Szmatloch\u2019s output from the 1960s through to the 1980s suggests sinister but undefined forces at work. At the end of the 1980s a change begins to take place, reflecting the political, economic and social restructuring of Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s Perestroika in the Soviet Union, culminating in the collapse of communism. \n\nSzmatloch\u2019s Slope is one of a series of cityscapes in which dark, shadowy walls give way to more open spaces. The apartment building beyond has a curious ambivalence about it, seeming both normal and cold at the same time.",
