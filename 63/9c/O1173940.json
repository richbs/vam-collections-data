These cloths were only used at the Snape Maltings - larger versions were created from Piper's original designs when the production was staged at Covent Garden and at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. Associated production: Death in Venice. Designer: John Piper. Performing company: English Opera Group. Aldeburgh Festival, Snape Maltings, Suffolk, 16.6.1973. Performance category: Opera. Production type: World premiere. See also proof set of 8 screen-prints based on the set designs for Death in Venice and lithograph print taken from the design for this cloth, S.24/i-1976.",
