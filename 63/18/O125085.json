(some col.).\nExhibition Catalogue\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp.66, 68\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\n\"The canvas has been relined at an unknown date.  A label on the stretcher is inscribed, not in the artist's hand and probably copying an inscription on the original canvas: <i>\"A summer Evening\" John Constable R.A.  Taken from the fields near E. Bergholt in the distance on the left is Langham Church, in the middle of the picture is Stratford Church and on the higher land in the distance under the tree in the middle is Stoke Church (by Nayland).</i>\nThe stretcher is also inscribed on the top in ink <i>Varnished with Fields lack varnish by C.R. Leslie R.A. in 1840.</i>\n\nThis painting was mezzotinted by David Lucas and published in <i>English Landscape Scenery</i> under the title 'Summer Evening' (S. 6).  In some lists of contents the title of the plate is given as 'Summer Evening.  Cattle reposing.  East Bergholt' (S. : L., pp. 230-1).  Shirley (S. : L., p. 163) says that the plate was begun by September 1829 and published in the third part of <i>English Landscape Scenery</i> in September 1831.\nThe moon, at the top left, has been moved an inch to the right and slightly lowered, as a <i>pentimento</i> shows.\nThe style is fairly close to that of No. 99 [138-1888] in its dark rich tonality and dragged brush-strokes.  Holmes, p. 241, dates <i>c.</i>1809.  For the scene depicted and the viewpoint, see note to No. 36 [587-1888] above.\"",
