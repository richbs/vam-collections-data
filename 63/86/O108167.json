The complex covered an area of 125 acres and was surrounded by high walls. It was one part of an entire city called Shahjahanabad, the seventh of the seven historical cities of Delhi.\n\nHere you can see the Akbarabadi gate, today known as the Delhi gate. It was one of the four large gateways into the fort and a main entrance to important parts of the city. The emperor would have used it to reach the Jami Masjid (mosque). \n\nThere was a large moat outside the fort walls which dried up after 1857. In Shah Jahan\u2019s reign, different types of gardens were planted beyond the moat to further separate the fort from the city. Known as the Buland (high), Gulab (rose) and Anguri (grape) gardens, they provided a visual contrast to the large expanses of the fort\u2019s red sandstone walls. \n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites. He set up a studio in Simla with Charles Shepherd and sold his prints sold to an eager public both in India and Britain.",

The palace complex covered  an area of 125 acres and was surrounded by high walls, it was one part of an entire city called Shahjahanabad. This was the 7th city of the seven historical cities of Delhi.\n\nOf the four large gateways into the fort, the Lahore and Akbarabadi gates were the main entrances and led to important parts of the city. This photograph shows the Akbarabadi gate, today known as the Delhi gate, which the emperor would have used to get to the Jami Masjid.\n\nThere was a large moat outside the fort walls which dried up after 1857 and beyond the moat during Shah Jahan\u2019s time different types of gardens were planted to further separate the fort from the city. Known as the Buland (high), Gulab (rose) and Anguri (Grape) gardens, they  provided a visual contrast to the large expanses of the fort\u2019s red sandstone walls. \n\nThis photograph shows the vast proportions of the fort walls and the barren land in front. After the Indian Mutiny of 1857, all buildings within 500 yards of the fort were demolished between 1858 and 1860 as part of the military reorganisation of Delhi.",
