By repute it was used by all subsequent Directors until Sir Roy Strong who took over in 1974.  By then it was being used by security staff at the gate, but was repaired and brought back into office use.  The original green leather upholstery was redone in woven white horse-hair, and the chair was recovered again in the present fabric in the 1990s.

Originally upholstered in green leather, the armchair was reputed to have been used by all the Directors up to Sir John Pope-Hennessy (Director 1966-1974), but was moved elsewhere when the Director's office was redecorated in 1974 for Sir Roy Strong.   After use in various other offices it was reupholstered in the 1990s and used once again in the Directorate offices. Two other chairs of the same type, but upholstered in green leather, are visible in record shots taken of the Directorate offices in 1998. The armchair was taken into the Furniture Collection in 2008 as an example of the furniture of Johnstone and Jeanes and as an early example of Museum office furnishing. It was put in store from 2009 to March 2014 when it was once again used in Directorate offices.",

The firm exhibited their furniture at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and at the International Exhibitions held in London in 1862 and in Paris in 1878. In 1885 the firm became Johnstone and Norman.",
