It is a one piece, close-fronted dress, consisting of a pointed bodice, top stitched to a trained skirt, and a stay, stitched on the reverse. \n\nThe bodice is made in three main pieces: an angled front panel and two sides. It is shaped at the waist with narrow pleats, lightly boned at the edge, has a lace-up fastening at the centre back and a wedge shaped panel applied at each side. The sleeves are of a short elbow length with a combination setting at the shoulder. There is a pocket slit on the right front seam.\n\nThe bodice and sleeves are lined with a lightly glazed white linen and have pockets for the insertion of bones on either side of the centre front and centre back opening. The hem is faced with white silk.\n\nThere are four twisted silk cords stitched inside each skirt breadth, except at the front, which can be attached to twisted floss silk buttons on the face of the skirt. By doing so, it draps the hem up in festoon fashion.",
