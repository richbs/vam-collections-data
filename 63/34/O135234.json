His career as a shoe-maker began properly in 1985. He first created the 'Wannabe' range of chunky loafers for Autumn-Winter 1993-94.\n\nThese shoes, for men and women, became so popular that a doorman had to be employed to manage the queues that formed outside his London shop. He became known as the man who made the loafer stylish and desirable. Each season, the basic 'Wannabe' loafer reappears in a fresh range of colours and surface designs. This one, from late 1998, is decorated with a non-functioning metal zip.\n\nIn a radio interview (BBC Radio 4) in 1997, Cox explained the shoe\u2019s appeal. 'I think the success of the \u201cWannabe\u201d loafer is the comfort factor and the cult that built around it\u2026even if you don't want to wear them any more because one too many of your friends have them or too many pop stars wore them that week\u2026you end up wearing them because they are so comfortable.'",
