In this painting, and typical of much of his style, he is working in the Dutch 'realist' manner of Jacob van Ruisdael. Indeed, the composition seems to have been inspired by that artist's famous Mill at Wijk in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, which M\u00fcller may have known through an engraving. In this landscape, his enthusiasm for the substance of oil paints and their uses in expressing such natural phenomena as windswept sea and the sky is very clear.\n\nM\u00fcller's attitude to his art was thoroughly modern, and shot through with Romantic energy and passion: 'I want to paint', he exclaimed, 'it's oozing out of my fingers'.  He was devoted to painting out-of-doors rather than in the studio, in close communion with the landscape, like Constable making written and graphic notes of light and weather. 'I do hope to see a storm', he noted during a painting tour of Wales, 'I long to see one'.",

His second Christian name is wrongly given as John in DNB. Apprenticed for two years with James Baker Pyne in Bristol; a Member of the Bristol Sketching Club. Exhibited 17 works at the RA between 1833 and 1845, 14 at the BI 1840-45, and ten at the SBA 1836-40. Travelled extensively, making drawings which he used later for finished and exhibited paintings: seven months in Germany, Switzerland and Italy with the watercolourist George Fripp 1834-5, Greece, Egypt, Malta and Naples 1838-9, and Turkey 1843-5. Suffering from a heart condition, he died young in Bristol 8 September 1845. His studio sale was at Christie's 1-3 April 1846, and his work achieved high prices for some years after. A sketchbook and several watercolours are also in the V&A collections. \nLIT: \tArt Union 1845, p318 (obit); Art Journal 1864, pp293-5; N Solly Life of William James M\u00fcller 1875; C Bunt The Life and Work of William James M\u00fcller Leigh-on-sea 1948; William James M\u00fcller Bristol City Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1962; there was an exhibition of M\u00fcller's work at the Tate Gallery 1985, but no catalogue seems to have been published. \n\nCoast Scene with Windmill \n1025-1886 Neg 56351 \nCanvas, 86.6 \u00d7 140.7 cm ( (34 1/8 \u00d7 55 3/8 ins) Signed and dated 'W M\u00fcller 1837' br \nDixon Bequest 1886 \nNot identifiable with the title of any exhibited work, nor with any of the titles given in Solly's various lists of works. The prices of M\u00fcller's paintings rose in the saleroom after his early death, and it seems likely that Flatou \n(Flatow), a dealer, bought this work and its companion (see Prov: below). \t\nThe general composition if not the detail is presumably taken from Jacob van Ruisdael's famous 'Mill at Wijk near Duurstede' (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam; repr in W Stechow Dutch Landscape Painting of the Seventeenth Century 1968, fig 115). \nPROV: \tL V Flatou sale, Christie's 29 March 1862 (118, 'A landscape, the companion - equally fine'), bought Cooper \u00a3246 15s (but according to Redford (Sales)  bought in); the companion to lot 117, 'Winter, a grand landscape.

He was devoted to painting out-of-doors rather than in the studio, in close communion with the landscape, like Constable making written and graphic notes of light and weather. 'I do hope to see a storm', he noted during a painting tour of Wales, 'I long to see one'.\n\nAlthough he died at the early age of thirty-three, M\u00fcller had travelled extensively in Europe and beyond, and produced a wide range of subjects.  Here, during his finest years, he is working in the Dutch 'realist' manner of Jacob van Ruisdael: indeed, the composition seems to have been inspired by that artist's famous Mill at Wijk in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, which M\u00fcller may have known through an engraving.   In this landscape, his enthusiasm for the substance of oil paints and their uses in expressing such natural phenomena as windswept sea and the sky is very clear.",
