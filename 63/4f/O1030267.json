The following is the full text of the entry: CARRACCI, LODOVICO (1555-1609) 657 Recto Study of a winged male figure falling head first, with another falling figure behind in the background Black chalk 14 5/8 x 10 (371 x 254) Dyce 297 Verso Study of a recumbent male nude, foreshortened, with the head projecting into the foreground; in the left margin two studies of clenched hands, one holding a tool, probably a pestle; in the top left hand corner two smaller studies of grasping hat cancelled by crossing out in black chalk Inscribed along the top margin in ink in an old hand 'Icaro di Mano di Lod. Caracci' and again in a different hand nearer the middle of the sheet 'Lod0 Caracci doppo visto Annibale' PROVENANCE Earl Spencer (Lugt 1532); A. P. F. Robert-Dumesnil (Lugt 2200); Dyce Bequest 1869 LITERATURE Dyce Catalogue no. 297 (as by Lodovico Carracci) The sheet has been torn into four roughly equal pieces and subsequently pieced together by pasting strips of paper along the rents, on each side alternately, in such a way as to cut across the drawings as little as possible. The studies do not appear to be connected with any surviving or recorded work of Lodovico or Annibale Carracci. In spite of the reference to Icarus in one the inscriptions on the verso, the main figure on the recto cannot be definitely identified as Icarus, since it is accompanied by another falling figure, which does not seem to be an alternative study, but looks though it were intended to be seen in the background, at a distance. The studies may perhaps have been made for a fall of the angels. The main figure seems to have wings and cannot therefore represent Phaethon or one of the giants overthrown by Jupiter or one of the damned in a Last Judgment.",
