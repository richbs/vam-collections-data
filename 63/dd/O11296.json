With its distinctive pink ground,  it imitates the type of wares made at the S\u0160vres factory in the 18th century, which continued in popularity throughout the 19th century in Britain.  The quantity of hand-painting and gilding makes it a relatively expensive item.\n\nPlace\nThe Coalport porcelain factory was established as John Rose & Co. at Coalbrookdale in Shropshire in about 1796.  Although Rose died in 1841, his name was retained as the company's title in the backstamp until at least 1865.  This plate also records the location of the works as 'Colebrook Dale'.  At this date the spelling seems still to have been variable; many wares were marked 'Coalbrookdale'. William Cook, believed to have decorated this plate, was one of the factory's most celebrated painters.",
