Toby was often played by a real dog, but more usually nowadays is another glove puppet when it features in the show. The mug was manufactured in Staffordshire as one of a set of six featuring the Punch and Judy characters Punch, Judy, Toby the dog, the Crocodile, Joey the Clown and the Constable. Punch and Judy shows are a feature of British seaside entertainment whose history in Great Britain stretches back to the puppet show that Samuel Pepys noted seeing in Covent Garden on 9 May 1662 performed by the Italian puppeteer Signor Bologna. \n\nStaffordshire Potteries specialised in producing utilitarian home ware in the 1970s, such as plates, bowls and mugs. Ironstone pottery was a form of durable, porcelain-like ceramic developed in the Staffordshire potteries area  during the early 19th century for mass production. The term 'ironstone' was patented by Charles James Mason, who issued wares with the backstamp 'Mason's Ironstone China'.",
