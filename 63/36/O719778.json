They make it certain that this table was intended for Virginia Prattle, who married the earl, Charles Somers-Cocks on 2 October 1850. The table was ordered and paid for by Lady Harriet Wegg-Prosser, daughter of the earl, presumably as a wedding present for her sister-in-law.\n\nThis is one of several designs, by Pugin, for interior decoration and furniture made for Earl Somers by J.P. Crace in 1849 and 1850. Pugin received \u00a320 for his work with J.P. Crace at Eastnor Castle. The work-table, octagon table, walnut book case and the chandelier were specially designed for the commission, but other pieces of furniture such as X-frame chairs seem to have been adapted by Crace from designs sent to him by Pugin in 1849 for his general use as a furniture maker.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
