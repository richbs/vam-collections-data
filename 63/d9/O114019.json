Barometers and thermometers offered elegant evidence of the owner's intellectual interests. This barometer is paired with a matching thermometer (Museum no. 1096-1882) and both are finely veneered in tulipwood and kingwood to take their place beside the finest furniture of a study or the small, personal rooms known as cabinets in France. The pair of instruments was acquired by John Jones, a British military tailor, in the 19th century. He was one of the best-known collectors of French 18th-century decorative arts and in 1882 he bequeathed his collection to the South Kensington Museum, the forerunner of the V&A.",
