In the same letter Constable goes on to comment on sketches such as Nos. 115 [121-1888] and 116 [146-1888] and incidentally to explain why they are of evening scenes: \"I am however perverse enough to be vain of some studies of landscapes which I have done...I am sure you will laugh when I tell you I have found another very promising subject at <i>Flatford Mill</i>.  I do not study much abroad in the middle of these hot bright days.  I am become quite <i>carefull of myself</i>, last year I almost put my eyes out by that pastime\".\n\nNotes on Nos. 115 [121-1888], 116 [146-1888], 117 [328-1888], 119 [324-1888], and 120 [127-1888]\n\nAnother oil sketch of the same type, \u2018Dedham Vale\u2019 in the Ashmolean Museum, is dated 13 July 1812; and an oil sketch dated 12 July 1812 was in the Staats Forbes Collection.  J. G. B\u00f6hler, <i>Constable and Rubens</i>, pp. 36 ff. discusses Nos. 115 [121-1888], 116 [146-1888], 117 [328-1888], and 120 [127-1888], and suggests that the influence of Rubens to be found in them may have been mediated through Lord Radnor\u2019s \u2018Escurial\u2019.  Constable is known to have seen this painting at some time between May and November, 1812.",
