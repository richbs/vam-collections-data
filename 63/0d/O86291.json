They were billed as \u2018a pair of real good comedians\u2019. When they appeared previously at the Grand in September 1903, the review noted that, \u2018Their fun in the trapeze is equal to anything that has been seen here\u2019. This is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nAcrobatic acts appeared as regularly in variety as they did in circus in the early 1900s. Comic acrobatics were also popular. The comic acrobats Burns & Evans followed Morris & Morris on the bill at the Grand during the following week in August 1904. They were also sketched by Cooke. Morris & Morris were on the same bill as the comedian George Brooks, another of Cooke\u2019s subjects.",

            "history_note": "This caricature is of the comic acrobatic duo Morris & Morris, on the bill at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley, for the week beginning 1 August 1904.  They were on the bill with George Brooks, 'a singer of good comic songs'; Miss Lizzie Daniels, 'comedienne'; Turle and Volto, 'trapeze artistes and comedy dancers'; Jack Lorimer, 'a comedian that will please everyone', and the Hadj Abdullah toupe of Arabs, 'tumblers and acrobats' who had appeared at London's Oxford Music Hall. Morris & Morris had appeared at The Grand in January 1903 when it was noted that 'Their fun on the trapeze is equal to anything that has been seen here'. It comes from the first of several albums compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke, featuring performers working in music halls in the early 20th century. The album is dated 1903-4-5.",
