As well as J.L.Toole (1830-1906) as the Artful Dodger, the cast included Toole's lifelong friend Henry Irving as Bill Sikes and Nellie Moore as Nancy. Posters with lithographic images were produced more frequently in the 1860s because of advances in printing technology and were a significant improvement on the earlier letterpress posters. By 1868 Toole was one of London's leading comic actors and the obvious choice for the poster image, while Irving, who was still relatively unknown, doesn't feature on the poster at all.\n\nThe earliest dramatised version of Dickens' 1837 novel was produced in London's Surrey Theatre in 1838. Several versions appeared in the intervening 30 years, many more successful than this one, which didn't please the first-night audience, although it still ran until July. Toole's performance as the Dodger however impressed one critic with its 'real artistic capability'. Irving's Sikes was noted for its 'almost terrible earnestness' and 'intensity of expression', characteristics of his acting which later made him a star.",
