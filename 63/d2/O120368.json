Born into a Jewish family in Frankfurt, she initially pursued an academic career before moving to Paris in 1930 to concentrate on photography. She emigrated from Paris to New York in 1941 and remained there after the war. Bing remarked on a stylistic change that had occured since the 1930s, attributing it to the war and her sense of isolation that developed in New York where she was an anonymous \u00e9migr\u00e9. She felt that she was \u2018in a vacuum\u2026looking out from the world as if from a space capsule\u2019. This photograph reveals a sense of nostalia and isolation. The child's writing suggests the presence of a child but the blackboard and chalks are removed from any context. Photographed close-up, they are an usual subject for a still-life.",
