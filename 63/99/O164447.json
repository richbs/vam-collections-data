In 1980, Wilson\u2019s interest in geometricism and technology led him to purchase a microcomputer and to teach himself computer programming.  The result was a series of early monochrome plotter drawings, produced in the late eighties and early nineties, of which three are now in the Patric Prince Collection at the V&A.  Wilson subsequentely adapted the software that he had written for the plotter drawings, and created digital files that were then sent to a large format archival printer to produce highly detailed prints such as this one. The digital file was generated using the PostScript programming language, which ensured that the images could be printed out as the artist intended.  \n\nTo create large digital prints such as this one, Wilson ran the computer software several times to produce a large number of images.  He then selected and saved the images he considered most successful, and drew them together to produce one composite image that combined elements of the images already produced.  The final appearance of the print was dependent on the artist's own editing process.",
