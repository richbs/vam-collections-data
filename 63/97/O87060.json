            "physical_description": "Painting, in opaque watercolour and gold on paper, two holy men stand in three-quarter poses facing towards each other with averted gazes.  They are standing in a landscape on a green ground dotted with tufts of grass of a darker hue.  In the foreground there is a band of muddy-coloured water with reeds and lily pads and several minute water birds which are quite out of proportion to the figures above, and may have been added later.  The green ground rises halfway up the painting to a blue sky with puffy clouds at the top, under which a naked <i>putto</i> with grey wings is seen flying while holding a red-covered book.\n\nThe man on the left is clothed in a white robe with a voluminous white shawl over his shoulders.  He has a bushy white beard and wears a rounded white turban.  His arms are held out in front of him and he is holding a black-beaded rosary looped over his outstretched hands.  He also has a thin red staff clutched to his body under his right arm.  He is shod in brown slippers.\n\nHis companion is attired in a pale robe which has a yellowish-greeny tinge to it under which he is wearing red and white vertically striped <i>paijama</i> over a pair of brown slippers.  His robe is tied in at the waist with a short white scarf and he is wearing a large dark brown shawl round his shoulders and upper body under which can be seen a band with delicately scrolling black ornamentation that is looped across his body and under his left arm.  He is holding a thin black staff in his right hand and a brown-covered book in his left with a red rosary looped over the wrist.\n\nThe modelling of the faces and the fold of the robes are modelled with washes of paint and not stippled.\n\nThe inner border has framing strips of buff-coloured paper which are decorated with a floral scrolling pattern in gold.  This is outlined in white with an outer gold line outlined in black.  Round this a blue line has been drawn on the ivory-round of the outer border which has similar gold-outline red poppies and deep pink lilies as those on the opposite page (IS.48:29/B-1956).  However, the gold veining on the leaves is more sketchy than that seen on page 29B which suggests a different hand.  The outer margins are embellished with a narrow red band of paper pasted onto them, outlined in white and edged with a gold line on their inner sides.  The left hand edge retains only remnants of this margin which has been replaced by a strip of crimson paper which acts as a gutter for the present binding.",
