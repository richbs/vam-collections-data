The strange design of three jumping fish with a monogram and the number 25 above, in Arabic, suggest that it was intended to act as an identification mark of some kind.  The shape is similar to that of a Persian, or Indian, amulet case which was worn on the upper arm.  The sliding lid at the top of the central section also suggests that it was used as an amulet case, but this does not necessarily mean that it had no other function.\n\nIt was bought for \u00a31 5s. at the International Exhibition in London in 1872.",
