Gilded frames were popular, and often extremely elaborate. This example is designed in the Neo-classical style popularised by Robert Adam (1728-1792) in the second half of the 18th century.\n\nPlaces\nThe mirror came from the Drawing Room at Bradbourne Hall, Kent, which was decorated in the Adam style in 1774 for Sir Roger Twisden, 6th Baronet.  The focus of the room was a coloured marble mantelpiece said to have come from Italy.  It is possible that the designer of the room was inspired by the chimney-piece, as similar Neo-classical motifs are repeated on both the plaster ceiling and mirror.\n\nMaterials & Making\nSome of the decoration is executed in composition, or 'compo', a doughy substance made of whiting, resin and size which could be moulded and shaped into motifs. The surface of the frame is water gilt.  Water gilding requires a gesso ground onto which several thin layers of an adhesive clay known as bole are applied.  The gold leaf is then 'laid down' after covering the surface in cold water.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nOn the cresting sit two winged gryphons, mythical creatures with the head, wings and claws of an eagle, and the body and hind legs of a lion. Similar gryphons appear in contemporary designs for decorative plasterwork by Robert Adam, for example on the ceilings of the Gallery and Hall at Harewood House, Yorkshire, and in the Long Gallery at Syon House on the south-west edge of London.",
