This example has rows of octagons of different sizes, rings of knotwork, and arabesques. Patterns of this type appear in Iranian paintings of the early 15th century, and in European paintings from the mid 15th century.\t\n\nPile carpets are one of many types of floor covering used in the Middle East. They are the most familiar to western Europeans as they have been imported from Turkey since at least the mid 15th century. Examples appear in Italian Renaissance paintings and are also depicted by north European artists such as Hans Holbein. Certain carpet designs became known in Europe by the names of the artists who painted them, including Holbein and Lorenzo Lotto.",
