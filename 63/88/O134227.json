Three of his brothers, George, Edmund and Frederick James, were also artists. Chiefly known as a watercolourist, he travelled in Wales and the Lake District in 1802 and 1803, working with Comelius Varley and Joshua Cristall: founder member of the OWS 1804. Artist on Lord Amherst's embassy to China 1816, resigned, and worked as portrait painter in India and Burma 1817-25. Visited Italy 1828-9. Exhibited 103 works at the RA between 1804 and 1857, 42 at the BI 1806-56, 32 (including five watercolours) at the SBA 1828-53, and 154 at the OWS. Subjects principally landscapes in Wales, Lake District, south and west England, Italy and China. Died Kensington, London, 16 December 1857. Redgrave believed 'his oil pictures show much excellence, and though rather yellow in tone and monotonous, the effect of sun and sunshine is admirably expressed'. There are fourteen watercolours by him in the V&A collections. \n\nLIT: Redgrave <i>Diet</i> and <i>Cent</i>; DNB. \n\n<b>The Thames at Datchet Ferry</b> \n209-1887 \nCardboard, 11.4 x 22.1 cm (4\u00bd x 8\u00be ins) \nPurchased 1887 \n\nThe scene is located in Buckinghamshire, near Windsor. The same view, without the foreground figures, was produced in an aquatint dated 1811 (see <i>Engr</i>: below) and published in 1812 as plate 11 in a volume of 12 'Picturesque Views of the Thames'. Watercolours of four further Thames views, at Caversham, Cliveden, Henley and Windsor, are also in the V&A collections. Other views of Datchet were published in Ireland's 'Picturesque Views on the River Thames' (1792) and Tombleson's 'Thames' 1834. \n\nPROV: The artist Thomas Webster, his studio sale, Christie's 21 May 1887 (179), bought by Agnew's for the museum \u00a34 4s \n\nENGR: Aquatint by Rand D Havell, published 1 May 1811\"",
