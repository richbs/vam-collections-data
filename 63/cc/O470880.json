Myself being a woman, born and brought up in a typical, middle class family, since childhood, I have seen, heard, felt and even undergone the same agonies. So the Indian woman, her surroundings, sufferings, her day to day problems, her position in the society as a 'girl child', adolescent, young woman, married woman, her the wife, the mother etc. are the images constantly before my mind.'",
