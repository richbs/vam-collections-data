It was probably worked from a pattern as another very similar pocket, inscribed with name 'ELIZABETH REYNOLDS', survives in the collection of York Castle Museum. While the pocket in York has tapes attached to it, suggesting that it was worn around the waist, this example does not. However it has clearly been well-used, perhaps as a 'tidy' for small dress accessories or needlework equipment. It is technically extremely accomplished and made with a hook in an unusual early form of crochet.",
