Studied at the life school in St Martin's Lane, and exhibited watercolours at the Society of Arts as early as 1836. Exhibited 164 works at the RA between 1838 and 1902 (and 50 Egyptian studies there in 1869), 33 at the BI 1839-41. His early works were mostly village genre scenes in the manner of Sir David Wilkie (whose works he also copied), but after travelling in Egypt in the late 1850s his work was principally Egyptian and biblical in subject, beginning with the ten-foot long painting 'Arabian Encampment at the Wells of Moses' in 1860. After 1889, he painted some English landscapes and a few portraits. Elected ARA 1852, RA 1863. Travelled in Normandy 1838, 1839 and 1840, Brittany 1841, 1842 and 1845, North Wales 1843, Ireland 1844, Venice 1857, and Egypt 1858-9 and 1870. Died St John's Wood, London, 28 August 1904. Two of his sons, Frederick Trevelyan (see below) and Howard, were also artists. Sales of his collections were at Christie's 25 May 1893 and (in the name of his daughter Ricca) 20 February 1905; there seems also to have been a sale at his house in Avenue Road, because of financial difficulties, in November 1902. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i>1850, p213 (a short 'autobiography'), 1855, ppl09-12; F Goodall Reminiscences 1902; <i>Art Journal</i> 1904, pp301-2 (obit); N G Slarke <i>Frederick Goodall</i>, RA Peterborough 1981\n\n<b>Cranmer, at Traitor's Gate</b> \n534-1882 Neg 53005 \nPanel, 45.7 x 74.8 cm (18 x 29\u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated 'F Goodall [partly obliterated]/1856' br \nJones Bequest 1882 \n\nPreviously catalogued as 'Archbishop Cranmer taken to the Tower', but exhibited at the RA in 1856 under the above title. The title was accompanied in the RA catalogue by a quotation from Samuel Rogers' poem: 'On thro' that gate misnamed, thro' which before/Went Sidney, Russell, Raleigh, Cranmer, More'. \n\nThomas Cranmer (1489-1556), Archbishop of Canterbury, was sent by Mary Tudor to the Tower of London for treason on 8 September 1553. He was removed to prison in Oxford in 1554 and burnt at the stake two years later. Events in his life were quite popular with 19th-century painters; F D Stephenson, for example, exhibited 'Cranmer Revoking his Recantation at Oxford' at the RA in 1835. Slarke implies that the dealer Ernest Gambart commissioned the painting; the <i>Reminiscences</i> state that he bought it, presumably from the RA exhibition. \n\nThe <i>Athenaeum</i> critic wrote that the painting marked 'an advance', but 'The merits of the work are more professional than general, and lie rather too much in the proprieties of colour, tone, and composition. There is certainly no intensity of feeling ... the <i>dramatis personae</i> are almost too dramatic, and are wonderfully unanimous in not looking the same way'. He concluded: 'One ray of faith or religion on his (Cranmer's) brow or forehead would have turned a clearer composition into a work of genius; but that wanting, this is only an \"eye feast\" of much excellence'. The <i>Art Journal</i> reviewer was more admiring: \n\nThis is a more solemn subject than any that has yet appeared under this name; ... the composition is admirably managed ... A strong feeling of interest and compassion is expressed in the features of the guards and attendants; but there is a monk whose malignant scowl represents the spirit of persecution under which Cranmer and others suffered. It is a work of high merit, different in everything from the buoyant tone of antecedent works. . .' \n\nSlarke records that the artist made many studies at the Tower of London ('much discomforted by the stagnant water of the moat') and 'As usual, he needed his supply of properties - there had to be a model for everything - and a Mr Meyrick, an expert on arms and armour, provided helmets, swords and other paraphernalia'. This was presumably Augustus Meyrick, who had inherited the famous collection of armour- also studied in the 1820s by Bonington and Delacroix - from his cousin, the antiquary Sir Samuel Meyrick. Much of the collection is now in the Wallace Collection. \n\nWhat appears to have been a version, or perhaps a finished sketch, of the subject was 'A Small Picture of Archbishop Cranmer taken to the Tower of London', sold by the artist's father Edward Goodall at Christie's 24 June 1864 (186), bought by Grundy for \u00a324 3s. \n\nPROV: Bought by the dealer Gambart 1856; Thomas Graham by 1857; sold Christie's (J M Threlfall sale) 14 May 1864 (194), bought Seguier \u00a3703 10; bequeathed to the museum by John Jones 1882\n \nEXH: RA 1856 (359); <i>Art Treasures</i> Manchester 1857 (457, lent by Thomas Graham)\n \nENGR: E Goodall (the artist's father) <i>Athenaeum</i> 10 May 1856, p560; <i>Art Journal</i>1856, p169; <i>Goodall</i>, p382; <i>Slarke</i>, p26\"",
