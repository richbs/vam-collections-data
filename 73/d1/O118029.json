A trade card was an advertisement, as well as a business card, which was often also used by the tradesman as a bill or receipt.\n\nAckermann and Co. was a publisher and print seller established in 1795 by Rudolph Ackermann (1764-1834). Born in Saxony and trained as a carriage designer, Ackermann moved to London in 1783. From 1800 he was the leading publisher of colour-plate books, decorative prints and fashionable periodicals. Ackermann's Repository of Arts was a periodical published from 1809-1827, which featured, among other subjects, literature, commerce, manufactures,  politics, fashions and costume plates. Like other fashion plate magazines of the period, La Belle Assemblee and the Lady's Magazine, Ackermann's Repository served as a guide to dressmakers and spread fashion ideas.\n\nCameo embossing involves printing the surround of the image, leaving the image itself embossed but not printed.",
