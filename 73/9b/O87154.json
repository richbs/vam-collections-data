It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years.  Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nThe Austrian violinist and composer Fritz Kreisler showed signs of musical genius from the age of four when he made his first violin from a cigar box.  He studied music in Vienna and Paris, and made his American debut in 1888 and his London debut in 1902.  Between 1900 and 1902 he gave concerts in France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Spain, England, America and Scandinavia and established himself as a leading violin virtuoso, and one of the most prolific, at one point giving 57 concerts in 72 days. He lived in Germany and France but settled in the USA in 1939, becoming a naturalised citizen in 1943",
