Not only was his reputation such that the Staffordshire potter Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) employed him regularly to supply block-moulds, but he also ran his own pottery, apparently without any conflict of interest. Long before the Victorian Age, when ceramic designs could be patented, the close-knit fraternity of Staffordshire potters accepted the sharing and copying of designs. The advantage was that identical tablewares or figures could be made simultaneously by several potteries in order to fill urgent orders.\n\n Recent excavations of Greatbatch's pottery site have revealed his distinctive style in his moulds, applied sprigs and engraved transfer-prints. Although the design of this particular teapot was not found there, its period and style make an attribution to Greatbatch most likely. And if the block-mould was made by Greatbatch, then the likely maker of the teapot would have been Wedgwood, or his partner during 1754-1759, Thomas Whieldon (1719-1795).",
