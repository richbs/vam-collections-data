In the background and elephant is going through his act with two keepers dressed in green. The foreground shows a walkway with a number of people in costume watching the act. These are probably the next acts waiting for the elephant to finish. One man has a red dressing gown with a yellow elephant depicted on the back and wears a pointed hat; another has red and green soldier costume and a rounded fur hat and is carrying a drum; another 'soldier' has yellow and blue costume and flat-topped fur hat; a man in green is rolling a larger drum-shaped stand of the kind an elephant might balance on during an act. In a doorway is a man in riding dress minding a horse and next to him a woman in blue and white dress with red ribbon belt tied in a bow. The border is grey and has a pattern of spots and wavy lines terminating in curls at the corners.",

Each lithograph had a drawn frame so that the print could be pinned to the wall. In the spirit of post-war optimism, artists responded enthusiastically. The scheme was a unique attempt at giving children access to original works of art in a period of austerity but ended in 1949 because of financial problems. Many of the prints depict a familiar world of everyday rural or urban life, some presenting a version of the pastoral idyll and others scenes of entertainment or leisure.",

The entrepreneur, Mrs Brenda Rawnsley, wrote: 'We are producing a series of auto-lithographs, four for each term, for use in schools, as a means of giving school children an understanding of contemporary art.'\n\nIn the spirit of post-war optimism, the artists responded enthusiastically, and submitted sketches to the selection committee, chaired by Herbert Read, which included influential R.R. Tomlinson, London County Council Senior Inspector of Art. Many of the prints depict a familiar world of everyday rural or urban life, some presenting a version of the pastoral idyll (John Nash 'Harvesting') and others scenes of festivity (Barbara Jones 'Fairground'), entertainment (L.S. Lowry 'Punch and Judy') or leisure (John Tunnard's surrealist 'Holiday'). Each lithograph had a drawn frame around the image so that the print could be pinned to the wall.",
