The faces of the front ribs of the 'X' frame are decorated with masks and a vine scroll on a punched background. The arm rests terminate in pommels, decorated with carved rosettes and fitted with rings carved from the same block of wood. The front seat rail is decorated with birds, somewhat primatively executed, and the back rest has a scrolled crest decorated with dolphins and a gadrooned base, partly replaced. The 'x' frame ribs, running from top right to bottom left could mostly be old, but those running from the top left to the bottom right seem mostly to be 19th century replacements.",

They were adopted by emperors and potentates, although, by 1550, they had become less symbolic of power and authority than they had been in earlier centuries. This example, although heavily restored, dates from about 1550, and would probably have been placed in a hall or chamber of a grand house. It formerly belonged to Jules Soulages of Toulouse (1812-1856), very much a pioneer in collecting decorative arts of the Renaissance. This type of chair was much copied from about 1880, when such tastes had become more fashionable, and most surviving  examples date from about then.",

Dealers of the 19th and 20th centuries referred to them as \"Savonarola\" chairs, named after Fra Girolamo Savonarola (1452 - 1498), who is unlikely to have ever sat on such a seat!  Large numbers of these chairs were made from about 1880 and found their way into middle-class households in Italy and throughout Europe, in keeping with the Renaissance Revival fashions, almost to the point where they became something of a clich\u00e9. Unfortunately many 'x' frame chairs were acquired by museums at this time under the illusion that they were authentic. The importance of this item is that a large proportion of it actually is authentic, particularly the highly decorative backrest, and it seems to have been restored rather than made up of old fragments of wood collared from a number of different chairs.",

It is noteworthy that as late as 1418 even the Medici had only six chairs in their residence in Florence. Although this example follows the 'x' frame pattern, long associated with Roman Emperors and Medieval princes, by about 1550 chairs were no longer entirely the preserve of the master of the house, and larger numbers were appearing in inventories. By 1609, even the hall porter in the household of Amerigo di Luca Pitti had two large cane-seated chairs (<i>seggiolaccie alla pistolese</i>) at his disposal.",
