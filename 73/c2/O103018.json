They are portraying the heroes Achilles and Ulysses from the classical Greek legends The Iliad and the Odyssey; in the background are symbols of their characters - to the left is Achilles's shield, to the right Ulysses's bow, which he alone could draw. \nThe pose foreshadows a major advance in dance technique. In the 18th century, dancers danced alongside each other, distanced by their hooped, stiff, formal costumes.  After the French Revolution of 1789, the new fashion was for Greek draperies for the woman and jackets and breeches for the men. This allowed the body much more freedom of movement and dancers were now able to dance together - which came to mean the man standing behind the woman to lift and support her.  \n18th century classical heroes would have worn a conventional costume called the tonnelet, a stiffened skirt which to our eyes looks like a ballet tutu, and acrobatic lifts like this would have been impossible.",

The print is part of the collection of dance prints amassed by Marie Rambert and her husband, Ashley Dukes in the first half of the 20th century.  Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest's A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.\n\nHistorical significance: This print is indicative of the increased possiblities in ballet technique with the disappearance of the heavy, formal costumes of the 18th century.  As women's fashions adopted the looser, more fluid Greek-drapery-inspired dress, so dancers, freed from the pannier, could now dance side by side.  For the men, this meant they could dance alongside or behind their partners and lift and support them; in the 18th century, men had been the great dance stars, but throughout the 19th centuy they dwindled into mere porteurs and presenters of the ballerina.   \nAlthough this is a pas de deux between two men, it does give an idea of the lifts and more acrobatic techniques that were coming into dance at this time.   From such moves would evolve the modern pas de deux.",
