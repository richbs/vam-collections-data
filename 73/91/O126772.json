His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel\u2019s career as a theatre designer began with a prestigious commission to make \u2018masks and symbols\u2019 for a Diaghilev Ballet production,  Z\u00e9phyre et Flore, in 1925.  The masks were exhibited at the Claridge Gallery and attracted the interest of C. B. Cochran (1872-1951), the theatre impressario. He commissioned Messel to make masks for his revues from 1926 onward, and subsequently asked him to design costumes and sets.  Messel also designed masks for private commissions and as interior decoration.\n\nThis mask may have been commissioned by a private individual or could have been designed for a theatre production.  Messel sewed fur fabric around an open weave cloth which has been painted with ape features.  The eyes are made from painted shells.",

            "history_note": "In 1922, after an education at Eton, Messel studied to be a painter at the Slade School of Fine Art under Henry Tonks; Rex Whistler was a fellow student.  Messel\u2019s formal studies concentrated on life drawing and painting, but Messel, along with Whistler, made masks from papier mach\u00e9 and wax for student events.  An  exhibition of Messel\u2019s masks at the Claridge Galleries in London in 1925 led to Messel\u2019s first theatre design commission to design masks for the prestigious Diaghilev ballet production of <i>Z\u00e9phyre et Flore</i>, directed by George Braque and performed at the London Coliseum in 1925.  Messel also made masks for other purposes including for friends to wear to dances, as lamp shades and for wall decoration.  \nCharles B. Cochran engaged Messel to design costumes, masks and sets for his annual revues at the London Pavilion from 1926 onwards; these revues, consisting of songs, sketches and chorus numbers, provided Messel with ample opportunities to develop and exercise his talent for minute attention to detail, inventive use of materials, including the use of rubber, dish cloths and fabrics painted to suggest embroidery, and imaginative borrowings from historical periods and styles. Messel\u2019s reputation grew slowly;  most notably,  critics praised Messel\u2019s disturbing masks for \u2018Dance, Dance, Little Lady\u2019, a song by N\u00f6el Coward from the 1928 Cochran revue entitled <i>This Year of Grace</i>; the scene was described by James Laver as \u201ca modern Dance of Death.\u201d  (Laver, 1933).\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.",
