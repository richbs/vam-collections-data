The tiles produced there were distributed widely in East Anglia, especially in the more populous northern areas, but also to the south and east of King's Lynn, where the tiles could readily be transported over the region's extensive network of inland waterways. The Bawsey tilery is known for the production of relief-decorated tiles, featuring birds, animals, heraldry or inscriptions. These designs were stamped into the surface of the tiles before they were fired using carved wooden blocks. When the wooden stamp for this particular tile was carved, the design was not reversed, as it should have been. In consequence, its inscription, 'Thomas', reads backwards.",

Three others were said to have been found at Spalding Church in Lincolnshire, Knipton Lodge, Bawsey, and at Castle Acre Priory in Norfolk. The V&A tile is also said to have come from the priory in Castle Acre. Castle Acre was a Benedictine Priory founded in about 1089. \n\nSpalding Church is dedicated to St Mary and St Nicholas (unknown how old dedication is). It was founded as a Benedictine Priory in 1051 by Thorold de Bokenhole and was rebuilt in 1294. Apparently, the Church of St Mary and Nicholas was built on the site of or incorporated a Chapel dedicated to St Thomas Becket. \n\nSue Cleary, President of the Spalding Gentlemen's Society, has confirmed that an agreement between the priory in Spalding and the local community exists and is dated to 1284. In this agreement, a new parish church was to be erected on the site of the Chapel of St Thomas Becket. It is said that the south transept side chapel of the new parish church was dedicated to Thomas the Martyr and was built in 1315. The 1284 document resides in the Britihs Museum (BM, Cole MSS).",
