Eric Griffiths, once of Pedigree and the re-styler of Sindy, created the heads and Alison Nisbet (daughter of Peggy) designed the costumes.\n\nMost of the series of dolls were issued as Limited Editions of 5000.  Each doll was individually boxed with a signed and numbered certificate.  If a doll had a special name, the name was printed on the head and also on the label attached to the clothing.",

This was discussed at length between the designer Eric Griffiths and Caroline Goodfellow and the decision was to produce china lower arms and hands.  One hand (right) would curved inward so it could hold an object such as a flower, and the left would be open so it could be used to hold strapped items or materials such as a shawl.  The hands designed are like those of Caroline Goodfellow, small and rather straight, and regardless of the length of the arm the fingers are short and stubby.",
