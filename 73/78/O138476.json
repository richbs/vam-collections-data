The photogram process balances planning with an element of chance: the varying shape, opacity and stillness of the objects allows more or less light to pass around and through them, creating fluctuations of tone and the sense of overlapping forms.\n\nFirst used at the invention of photography in the 1830s, the process was forgotten until the early 20th century, when it was revived by several avant-garde artists, including Man Ray, who called his photograms 'Rayographs.'  Moffat probably learned the technique from Man Ray, when he collaborated with him in Paris in 1923.  Moffat's photograms are among the earliest examples of the 20th-century interest in camera-less, abstract photography.",
