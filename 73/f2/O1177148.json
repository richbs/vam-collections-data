Her father had the set made for her in 1944 when he was posted to India whilst serving in the British Army. The set, made from wood, consists of pots, pans, a cooker, utensils and a well. \n\nThe cookery set is important to the Museum's collection because there are examples of cookery sets made in England, Japan and Germany, but few from India. This wooden set stands in contrast to the more common plastic sets, or even the china ones. Its design is simple and plain, and highlights the differences between different cultures. The cookery set sits very well with the collection, demonstrating creative and imaginary play.",
