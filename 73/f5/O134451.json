            "public_access_description": "Sindy the British teenage doll was launched in September of 1963. Produced by toy company Pedigree she wore one of her most well-known fashion outfits the 'Weekender' outfit, a red, white and blue jumper, blue jeans, white pumps and red hair band. Sindy also had her own promotional record 'Sindy and the Dolly beats' and the slogan 'the doll you love to dress'. Sindy had everything a teenager of the 1960s could wish for, including a handsome boyfriend, Paul. Patch, Sindy's little sister was also introduced to whom Sindy could pass down her wisdom of fashion.\n\nOver Sindy's 40-year reign she has been a keen follower of fashion and has been produced by several different manufacturers. In 1968 she received one of the first of many makeovers. Named the 'New Look' Sindy she was given side-parted hair, real eyelashes and a twisting waist. 'Lovely Lively' Sindy of 1971 was given a muti-jointed body which made her more life-like and more fun to play with. Though Sindy had many careers, like Ballerina, City Girl or Pop Star, she was definitely much more a girl of leisure. In 1983 'Party Girl' Sindy was introduced inspired by Diana, Princess of Wales. Money was also never in question for Sindy. She had houses and cars galore as well as many exotic holidays.\n\nSindy is still around today but does not have the impact on the market that she once had. She has been remodelled in 2004 by a company called New Moons and has a new flexible body and new range of clothes, cars and houses.",
