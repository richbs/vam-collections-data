These cave paintings date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480 and are the oldest surviving examples of painting in India. They depict stories from the lives of the Buddha (the Jatakas).\n \nHere the Bodhisattva sits beneath the Bodhi tree, seeking enlightenment or \u2018awakening\u2019. Mara (the princely figure on the right-hand side), lord of the sensual world, tries his best to prevent this. He sends demons and seductive women to distract him. The Bodhisattva remains unmoved. He summons the goddess of the earth (standing on his right-hand side) to testify to his virtue. Despite the temptations, he achieves enlightenment and Mara is defeated.\n\nThe cave complex was discovered in 1819 and attempts were made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Unfortunately most of the paintings he completed were destroyed in a fire in 1866. To make up for this loss, from 1872 to 1885 John Griffiths from the Bombay School of Art and seven Indian students spent every winter at the caves. This is one of the most elaborate of the approximately 300 paintings they produced.",

This painting depicts the Maravijaya jataka - the Assault and temptation of Mara on the eve of Enlightenment.\n\nNarrative:\nThis painting recounts the story of the Bodhisatva before he became the Buddha. Here he is shown seated underneath the Bodhi tree (the tree represented by a branch with three leaves on it). He is determined not to leave this seat until he reaches  enlightenment or \u2018awakening\u2019. However, Mara, lord of the sensual world, seen here on the right hand side as a princely figure adorned with ornate jewels, tries his best to stop him from achieving this and sends an army of demons to attack him. \n\nThe Bodhisatva remains unmoved and with his hand extended to touch the ground he summons the goddess of the earth, seen here standing on the right hand side of him, to testify to his virtue. Mara also sends his daughters to seduce him, seen here below the Bodhisatva, in alluring poses. Enlightenment is achieved and the scenes depicting Mara\u2019s defeat are only just visible here. In the bottom left hand corner is an Asoka tree under which Mara is said to have sat in despair at his failure and on the bottom right hand side a scene just below Mara shows warriors stuck to the ground, testifying to Mara\u2019s defeat.",

They depict scenes from the lives of the Buddha and date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480. The cave complex was discovered in 1819 and since then attempts have been made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Unfortunately most of the paintings he completed were destroyed in a fire in 1866. To make up for this loss, from 1872, John Griffiths from the Bombay school of Art and seven Indian students spent every winter for the following 13 years at the caves producing approximately 300 paintings, of which this is one.",
