One of these papers (\u2018Spray') was not designed by Morris, but was produced by the firm and was based on an earlier paper removed from a house, 'Palace Ann', near Brandon, County Cork, and given to Morris by Charles C. Townsend, architect, in 1866. (Information found on the backs of photographs of the house by Miss Caroline C. Townsend, daughter of the architect.)\n\n'Scroll', <i>circa</i> 1871 (E.3698); 'Branch', <i>circa</i> 1871 (E.3699); 'Trellis', 1864 (E.3700-3703); 'Diaper', <i>circa</i> 1868-70 (E.3704); 'Indian', <i>circa</i> 1868-70 (E.3706-3709); 'Fruit', 1862, produced 1864 (E.3710-3712; E.3710 neg GJ.9636); 'Spray', <i>circa</i> 1871 (E.3713, 3714; E.2807 neg GJ.9661); 'Venetian', <i>circa</i> 1868-70  (E.3715-3717); 'Daisy', 1864 (E.3718, 3720); 'Queen Anne', <i>circa</i> 1868-70 (E.3721, 3722).'\nParry, Linda, ed. <u>William Morris</u> London : Philip Wilson in association with the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1996. Published to coincide with an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, 9 May-1 Sept. 1996, p.206.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'<b>L.4</b> Wallpaper sample, <i>Indian, Red Indian</i> \nPossibly designed by George Gilbert Scott, first issued 1868-70 \nPrinted by Jeffrey & Co. for Morris Marshall, Faulkner & Co. \nBlock-printed in distemper colour (also available as a two-colour print), 68.6 x 50.0 cm \nV&A (E.3706-1927) \nGiven by Morris & Co. \n\n\u2018Mural Decoration\u2019 in <i>The Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, XVII, 1884, by Morris and Professor Middleton, illustrates the source of this pattern, describing it as an \u2018Early 18th-century wall-paper\u2019. It is one of a group of four designs (the others are <i>Queen Anne, Spray</i> and <i>Venetian</i>), adapted from earlier examples, which were possible designed by G. F. Bodley and his associates. \n\nSimilarities between the firm\u2019s group of adapted patterns and the early papers of Watts & Co., founded in 1874 by Bodley, George Gilbert Scott Jnr. And Thomas Garner, tend to support the connection and a generally accurate account of Bodley\u2019s career (E. Warren, \u2018The Life and Work of George Frederick Bodley\u2019, <i>Journal of the RIBA</i>, 3rd ser., 17, 1910, pp.305-36) states that he had designed one or two of William Morris\u2019s early wallpapers. \n\nWarington Taylor refers (V&A NAL) to a wallpaper as \u2018Scott\u2019s \u201cIndian\u201d\u2019, which perhaps suggests that George Gilbert Scott Jnr. Was the designer. \n\n<i>Spray</i> and <i>Queen Anne</i> were based on samples found by Chambrey Corker Townshend (see V&A NAL and Townshend Nominal File), who had been a pupil in the office of G. E. Street, also an associate of Bodley and Scott.'",
