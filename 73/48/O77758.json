            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis large taper stand came from a public house in Brigg, Lincolnshire.  It is of special interest because of its unusual construction.  The brass elements from which it is made, such as the baluster mouldings and brass plates fretted out with designs of scrolling foliage, are characteristic of English 17th-century lantern clocks.  Its size and sophisticated decoration indicate that it would have occupied a central place in the household, probably in one of the main public rooms, and would have been used to light the candles for the entire house.  Silver versions of the design of this taper stand are also known.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe coil of taper is held in a split plate tensioned by a spring.  This serves to keep the end of the taper vertical and allows it to burn down only as far as the plate should the flame be left burning.  The wax-covered taper would be softened by the heat of the flame and the split plate would then close extinguishing the flame.  This was an important feature at a period when accidental fires were very frequent because of the use of lamps and candles for light.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe pierced designs and engraved dials indicate that this taper stand was either made by a craftsman who was a specialist maker of cases for lantern clocks or was made for a clockmaker, of familiar elements to complement his trade.",
