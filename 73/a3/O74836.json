She liked informal, relaxed clothes and jersey was her favourite material. Here she designed a supple top and skirt that could be worn all day in great comfort but was extremely chic. The skirt has slightly irregular, soft pleats. These are anchored so they would never go awry. She has made the top, with its cap sleeves, from just one front and one back panel. It fastens at the left side and back neck with loops and shining black buttons. These buttons are a typical McCardell detail.",
