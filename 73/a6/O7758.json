The octagonal vessel has a U-shaped handle and curved spout held by a porcelain stay. The foot-ring has applied bands of die-struck ovolo in high relief. Eight heavy-guage vertical strips are shaped to the porcelain foot; applied to the exterior is a light-gauge strip struck seven times with a bird and swag repeat. Below the neck a white silver band rises from a pierced border crudely engraved with a linear repeat. The (restored) neck has a gilt mount attached to a silver lining. The spout tip is sheathed with white silver, lightly engraved. Seven panels of the octagonal neck mount are engraved respectively with a wolf, a dog, a hare, two more dogs, a boar and a dog in foliage. The hinge-box (now cemented to the handle) was originally secured by three pins, now missing. The shaped side panels of the hinge-box are engraved with birds, the curved centre panel with a fruit pendant terminating in a pierced acanthus chased and shaped to the handle. The cast mermaid and cornucopia thumb-piece is soldered to an extension of the cover. The octagonal cover is embossed and chased with three variant horned masks in  elaborate burnished cartouches between fruit pendants on a matted ground. (P.

It was made in Jingdezhen, a city in central southern China that mass-produced thousands of similar pieces.  Some were for the home market and some for export. \n\nMaterials & Making\nIn late 16th century Europe, porcelain was a valuable and expensive material.  Many people were still not certain what it was.  Some said it was a precious stone, or a composite material made from crushed shells. The possession of such items made of hard, white, translucent material and decorated in fine detail, denoted wealth and high social standing.  For this reason such 'exotica' were often enhanced with metal mounts.",
