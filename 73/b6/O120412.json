The suite was covered in green silk damask, matching the festoon curtains of the room's three windows. The form and the carved ornament recall the style of furniture designed by the architect William Kent in the 1720s-30s, but the delicacy of the carving suggests a later date. From inventories of the London house it is clear that the suite was not made until after 1754. It was probably made soon after that date by the leading London cabinet-maker Benjamin Goodison, who was owed \u00a3120 by Lord Guilford in 1756.",

Although the suite ended up at Wroxton, it was evidently made originally for Lord Guilford's London house, in Grosvenor Square, where it was inventoried in 1767 (following his wife's death on 22 December 1766): \n\"12 Mahog<u>ny</u> Open back Ch<u>rs</u> \nCoverd with Green Silk Dam<u>k</u> \nand Serge Cases\n2 Sofas Ditto and Cases\"\n(Bodleian Library, Oxford: MS North e. 40, ff. 5f., \u2018An Inventory of Goods, belonging to the Rt. Honble. The Earl of Guilford taken at His House in Grosvenor Sqr. February 17th. 1767 and the days following\u2019).\nThe suite is not recorded in earlier inventories of the London house made in 1751 and 1754 (Bodleian Library: MS North b. 14, ff. 310r--315v, 405r--409v), so it was presumably made after 1754. It may well, therefore relate to a debt to Benjamin Goodison of \u00a3120 recorded in 1756 (Bodleian Library: MS North b. 15, f. 15, 'List of Bills remaining unpaid / At Michmas 1756 ...

Those payments, however, all relate to the Wroxton estate, whereas the settee is part of a suite that was first recorded in Lord Guilford's London house, in 1767 - and is conspicuously absent from earlier inventories of the house, taken in 1751 and 1754 (see Object History). So it was probably made following Lord Guilford's third marriage in 1751, and indeed apparently after 1754. It may relate to a debt of \u00a3120 recorded as owing to Benjamin Goodison in 1756 (see Object History). The delicate treatment of the carving is consistent with such a date.",
