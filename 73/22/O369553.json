The stamps used include dot punches, small crescents, two sizes of circle with central dot, and two sizes of shell or fan motif. \n\nThe shaped frame includes a view of a formal garden with two rows of four cypress trees in receding lines, flanking a large vase of reversed baluster form, with flowers emerging at the top and sides. The raised and punched design finishes approximately 5 cm from each side. \n\nOn the left (PR) side 2 bronze studs remain in place, each in the form of a saltire cross, with knobbed ends to the arms, the centre with a raised roundel, incised with a cross running between the longer arms.\n\n\n\n<u>Construction</u>\nThe chair back is made of single skin of bovine leather, with two small sections skived and grafted to the lower left (PR) edge. The leather varies in thickness, to a maximum of 4 mm. \n\nThe top and bottom edges are bound with strips of thinner leather (probably sheep's or goat's), stitched with a thick thread, probably of linen. The original stitching is done with two threads, giving a continuous line of stitching (the tradition way of stitching leather). Most of the top binding has been repaired in wax thread, using back stitch. Some of the stitching on the lower edge has been reinforced with a second thread. The cut-aways for the arms are not bound. The right (PL) one is cut with a small central tab, which has been torn away on the left (PR) side. This would have been folded and attached to the inner side of the upright, from the back of the chair. Each side of the panel shows 5 pairs of holes for studs on the front face and the adjacent area which would have been folded to the side of the uprights. Intermediate holes are visible on the side flaps only. \n\nThe design on the leather has been worked by incising the leather and then raising it by pushing the leather, to create a sculpted effect without cutting into the finished surface beyond the lines of incision. The design is then highlighted by colour and gilding. \n\nThe right side (PL) edge shows a large irregular X-shaped dark mark, possibly created by a chemical.",

            "public_access_description": "Upright chairs with back and seat panels of stretched leather had been used in Spain and Portugal since at least 1600 and the design was taken up in their colonies in South and Central America.  This panel was probably made in Portugal or Brazil. The design remained in use until well into the 18th century, only changing in the details of decoration on the leather.  This chair back must date from after 1730 because the design is contained within a frame made of the pierced, frilled ornament known by the French word rocaille.  Rocaille decoration gave its name to the Rococo style, which came into fashion in the period 1730-1760 throughout Europe. The exotic central urn with flowers and the avenue of cypress trees shown in perspective behind it, are both motifs that had survived from the earlier Baroque style.  Such leather panels offered a simple form of upholstery, with no additional padding.  One of the decorative metal nails that fixed the panel to the back uprights of the chair is visible on the left.",

['A backrest from a chair, in raised and painted leather. Spanish or Mexican, 17th century'].  Plate VIII shows a chair back still on its original chair, with an identical border but a different central scene (of a fountain with ducks, and two men with shotguns in the foreground).  The men depicted on that chair back wear distinctly 18th-century clothing, which confirms the dating of the V&A chair back.  That chair was, in 1925, in the collection of a Monsieur Frandin. ",
