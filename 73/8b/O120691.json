Its history between then and 1867 is unknown, but the engraved inscription on the bottom of the jewelled gold mounts added to the foot show that by then it had come to England. The inscription reads: \"Robert Phillips fecit London 1867\" (made by Robert Phillips London 1867). He was a jeweller with premises in Cockspur Street, and exhibited the bowl at the 1867 Paris Exposition Universelle where it won a gold medal. At some later point, it was acquired by Colonel Charles Seton Guthrie (1808-1874) and added to his remarkable collection of Mughal hardstones. Some of his pieces were bought by the Indian Museum in London in 1868, but the rest of the collection was sold at auction in 1875, the year after his death. This bowl was probably lot 202 in the Christie's sale.  It was bought by Mr Alfred  Simson who lent it as part of his small collection of Mughal crystal to the museum in 1913 and 1919. His son, Captain Rupert Simson, sold it to the museum in 1920 in accordance with his father's wishes.\n\nThe jewelled mount is enamelled and set with minute diamonds, agates, rubies and lapis lazuli and is one of two examples in the V&A of Mughal rock crystal bowls with Phillips mounts.",
