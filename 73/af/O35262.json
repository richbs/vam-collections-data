His work brought him into contact with the Montmartre circle of artists including Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, though it is clear from looking at this poster that Grasset's work was more conservative than that of the avant-garde Toulouse-Lautrec. \n\nThe poster was commissioned by Sarah Bernhardt, the French actress, to advertise her stage appearance in the role of Jeanne d'Arc, or Joan of Arc, and Grasset clearly evokes the saint's piety in the design of the poster, which strongly resembles a stained glass window.",
