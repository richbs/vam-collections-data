Apprenticed to a publisher 1808, received a few lessons in painting from Thomas Sully. A subscription was raised to enable him to study art in Europe; returned.to London 1811, entered RA Schools and studied with Benjamin West and Washington Allston. Visited Paris 1817 with Allston and Wilkie Collins, met G S Newton, with whom he visited Brussels and Antwerp. Also friend and biographer (published 1843) of John Constable. Exhibited 76 works at the RA between 1813 and 1859, and 11 at the BI 1815-32. Some were portraits, but most were his much admired literary subjects, particularly drawn from Cervantes, Moliere, Shakespeare and Steme. Elected ARA 1821, RA 1826. Several of his works were engraved, and he made six illustrations for Sir WaIter Scott's Waverley novels 1824. Worked for six months as drawing master at West Point Military Academy, New York State, 1833. Professor of Painting at RA 1848-52; his lectures were published as a <U>Handbook for Young Painters</u> (1855). His <u>Life of Reynolds</u> was finished by Tom Taylor and published 1865. Died St John's Wood, London, 5 May 1859. An exhibition at the RA of  30 of his works was held winter 1870. His two sons, George Dunlop and Robert, were also artists. The <u>Athenaeum </u>critic (9 May 1846, p480) wrote that he was 'unrivalled for the certainty of his powers, the <i>wi</i>t of his pencil, the deep knowledge of human nature as exhibited in the more ordinary scenes of life'.\n\nLIT: <u>Art JournaI</u>1856, pp73-5 and 105-7, 1859, p187 (obit); C R Leslie <u>Autobiographical Recollections</u> ed T Taylor, 2 vols, 1860; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by C R Leslie </u> nd [1875]; <u>Art ]ournaI</u>1902, pp 144-8; J Constable <u>The Letters of John Constable and C R Leslie</u> 1931; ed R B Beckett John <u>Constable's Correspondence</u> III, Ipswich 1965 \n\n\n<b>The Two Princes in the Tower</b> \nFA124 Neg 69790 \nCanvas, 33 X 43.1 cm (13 X 17 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \nAccording to Taylor (<u>Leslie </u>II, pp320-l), the artist painted two versions of this composition, the first in 1830 for Mr Rogers (see <i>versions</i>: below), and the repetition in 1837, which was recorded as in Sheepshanks's collection but not as specifically painted for him. \nIn a letter to Leslie from the American author Washington Irving of 21 April 1826, quoted by Taylor (<u>Leslie </u>II, p179), the literary source for the \npainting is discussed: \t\n\nThe old play about which you inquire, as containing scenes relative to \nthe young princes in the Tower, is by Middleton, entitled the 'First and \nSecond Part of Edward IV'. If you wish the scenes for any professional \npurpose I can transcribe them for you in a letter, as I have them by me, \nbut I do not wish to put any literary forager on the track of this play, as I \nhave an article on the subject half sketched among my papers, which I \nintend some day or other to make use of. \n\nIn a footnote, Taylor comments that the play is by Thomas Heywood [1599] 'and has been reprinted by the Shakespeare Society. Leslie painted a very touching sketch ... '. The lines relevant to Leslie's composition are from act 3 scene 5: \n\n<i>Richard</i>: O Lord, methinks this going to our bed, How like it is to going to our grave. \n<i>Edward</i>: I pray thee do not speak of graves sweet heart, Indeed thou frightest me. \n<i>Richard</i>: Why my Lord Brother, did not our Tutor teach us, That when at night we went unto our bed, \nWe still should think we went unto our graves. \n<i>Edward</i>: Yes, that's true, yet we should do as every Christian ought, To be prepared to die at every hour, but I am heavy. \n<i>Richard</i>: Indeed so am I. \n<i>Edward</i>: Then let us say our prayers and go to bed. (They kneel.) \n\nThere had always been much interest in the uncertain fate of Richard Duke of York and (the briefly) King Edward V, their imprisonment in the Tower of London in 1483, and their murder supposedly at the order of the Duke of Gloucester, later Richard III. Paintings of the subject were not exhibited at the RA as frequently as might be thought: Strong lists only 17 associated with the story between 1769 and 1893, and only four which seem to deal specifically with the two princes in the Tower <i>(And When Did You Last See You Father?</i> 1978, pp159-60). Leslie's most immediate predecessor was Henry Singleton in 1797, and closest successor Millais in 1878. Strong rightly draws attention to Delaroche's painting of 1831 (exhibited at the Paris Salon 1831, now Wallace Collection), and the degree of sentiment in the story (ppl19-21); he comments on the Millais painting (now Royal Holloway College) that 'he skilfully married the record of a historical event with another, perhaps even more potent Victorian obsession, the innocence and vulnerability of childhood'. T S R Boase thought the work 'shows how he could turn a tale of horror to prettiness'. \n\nEXH:<i> Victorian Narrative Paintings</i> V&A circulating exhibition 1961 \nLIT: <u>Leslie</u> I, plxvii, 11, pp179, 320-1; T S R Boase <u>English Art 1800-1870</u> 1959, p172, repr pl 65a \n\n<i>Version</i>: Painted for Samuel Rogers 1830; his sale, Christie's 28 April-10 May 1856 (529, as 'The Infant Princes in the Tower'), bought Gambart \u00a3225 15s; Joseph Gillott in 1860; his sale, Christie's 19 April-4 May (175, 33 X 43.2 cm/13 X 17 ins), bought Permian \u00a387 3s \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
