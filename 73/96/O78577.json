A tapered cylindrical form of pot was originally used for both coffee and chocolate, but the earliest known silver teapot, dated to 1670, is also of this shape (museum no. M.399-1921). By the 18th century the spout was often placed at right angles to the handle on coffee and chocolate pots.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThe engraving on the coffee pot reveals that this was a gift to the East India Company. Founded in 1600, the English East India Company was incorporated by royal charter to develop trade with India and East Asia. The Museum's silver teapot of the same form was also presented to the East India Company, in 1670.",
