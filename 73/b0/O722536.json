Two curved candle sockets emerge from the base of the urn. Below these are acanthus c-scrolls and a pine cone.\n\n'No. 211' A design for a girandole. The main feature of this girandole is an urn or oil lamp with a very wide girth. The urn is flanked by two rams' heads which have husk swags hanging from their mouths to the candle sockets. The sockets are supported by looped acanthus scrolls. The apron features acanthus leaves, foliage and bellflowers.

On either side of the palmette are acanthus scrolls with husk festoons looped over them, supported on either side by a bow.\n\n'No. 210' A design for an oval, almost circular, pier glass. The frame features neoclassical moulding. The crest is topped by a bow which loops down supporting a patera. Husk festoons loop down from the bow and are supported around the frame by acanthus scrolls. A ram's head is placed at the top of the apron, with acanthus leaves below.\n\n'No. 209' A design for a girandole. Half of the design is highly finished, the other half is barely sketched. Husk festoons fall from the handles of the urn finial and are supported by acanthus scrolls around the sides. The frame features neoclassical moulding. The apron features a patera surrounded by husk festoons, acanthus leaves and bellflowers below.\n\n'No. 208' A design for an oval pier glass.

            "public_access_description": "This design is part of a group of over 900 drawings of frames, mainly for pier glasses, overmantels, and girandoles. Many of these workshop designs share similar characteristics such as leaf scrolls and festoons of husks. Most of them are numbered, contain information about who ordered them, the date, the price (written in code), the colour of the frame and the dimensions of the finished object. \n\nThe drawings from John Linnell's workshop survive over the period 1773 to 1783. From April 1773 to August 1778, the workshop produced about twelve pieces a month. Production decreased over the next two years to 3 or 4 pieces a month. In 1783 these designs were no longer produced.\n\nRobert Adam, a leading architect, was a key influence on the neoclassical designs of John Linnell. Linnell worked with Adam for the first time at Kedleston Hall, Derbyshire, and they worked together on a number of other occasions. In the early 1770s festoons of husks began to be used on pier glasses and they are very prominent within these workshop designs. \n\nJohn Linnell (1729-1796) was the son of the famous furniture maker William Linnell (ca. 1703-1763). Unlike most furniture makers, John Linnell gained a design education at the St. Martin's Lane Academy, which was founded by William Hogarth in 1735. In 1750, aged 21, he joined his father's firm as a designer. On his father's death in 1763, John Linnell took over the family firm. During his lifetime John Linnell produced high quality furniture, which rivalled that of other leading furniture makers such as Thomas Chippendale, John Cobb and William Ince and John Mayhew.",
