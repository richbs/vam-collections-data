He then travelled through Florence where he was persuaded to stay. He became sculptor to the Medici family and thus became one of the most influential sculptors of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. He drew attention to many artists  from Northern Europe and disseminated his style mainly through small bronzes. He established an efficient and large workshop.\n\nThe Rape of the Sabines is a legend in the early history of Rome. According to that Romulus, the founder of the city, used a trick to secure the future population of Rome. He organised a festival where the neighbouring inhabitants were invited, including the Sabines along with their wives and children. At a certain signal Rome's young men went into the crowd and carried away the unmarried wives. Plutarch has described to this legend the origin of the custom of lifting up a bride and carrying her over the doorstep of her husband's house.",
