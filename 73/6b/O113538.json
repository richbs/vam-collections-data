In the 1750s, most sets that were recorded in bills or inventories were painted or lacquered, but this set is made of mahogany, both solid and veneered. It is very close in form to a set stamped by the maker Denis Louis Ancellet and may also have been made by him.  He often worked with the more famous cabinet-maker Adam Weisweiler, probably making items for him as a sub-contractor.  A few pieces survive that carry the stamps of both men.",
