It features an anthemion and a palmette linked by scrolls.  The actual plaster ornament was produced by pressing 'composition' into the mould.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe anthemion motif is inspired by the shape of the honeysuckle flower.  The palmette is a stylised fan-shaped leaf, loosely based on a palm leaf.  Both were usually extensively in the ancient world, on major architectural monuments down to domestic pottery objects.  These motifs became popular once again during the Renaissance and especially at the end of the 18th century, when Greek and Roman ruins were extensively excavated.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe mould was made by a specialist carver for firms making composition ornament. Boxwood is very hard and  can take a great deal of detailed carving. Its hardness also makes it robust, necessary for a mould such as this which has been reused countless times.\n\nComposition ('comp' for short) is a type of paste or putty made from glue, rosin (resin), linseed oil and whiting (chalk). It was pressed into the oiled mould and squeezed in a screw press. The pressing was removed from the mould while still flexible and applied to a backing. \n\nTime\nMoulds of this kind were used widely from about 1780 until about 1900. The use of moulds to make plaster reproductions reduced the demand for ornamental carvings in wood. After about 1850 the manufacturing process became more mechanised, though moulds continued to be used.\n\nPeople\nThe mould was part of a collection owned by George Jackson & Sons, Ltd, a firm founded by George Jackson (1756-1840).",
