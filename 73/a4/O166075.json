In the wake of its privatisation, the company wanted to move away from its image as a faceless, state-owned telecommunications system and instead stress the human aspect of its activities. Launched in 1991, the logo of the piper blowing a trumpet was designed with this goal in mind. The graceful image took inspiration from Modernist painters like Matisse and Picasso. Wolff Olins actively encouraged its designers to reinterpret the pioneering work of fine artists and to experiment with symbolism, an approach which is evident in this design.\n\nAt one point there were as many as forty people in separate teams working on the BT project. It became a laborious process of drawing, submitting the ideas for evaluation, then re-drawing and refining. \n\nWolff Olins suggested that David Hockney should render the final image, but in the end it was painted by an anonymous artist. Although the logo was criticised in the press, it did remain in use until 2003.",
