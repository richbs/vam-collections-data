A.3-1965). The V&A also has on long-term loan a bronze roundel of Handel by Roubiliac, which is related, though not exactly the same as, the present terracotta.

A., 1961, from Messrs Peel and Humphris, Bond Street, London, for \u00a3250.\n\nHistorical significance: Roubiliac made a number of images of the celebrated German composer, who spent much of his working life in London. Roubiliac himself was  a native of France, and his first known independent work in England after his arrival in 1730 was the full-length marble statue of Handel made for Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens in 1738 (now in the V&A, inv. no. A.3-1965). The V&A also has on long-term loan a bronze roundel of Handel by Roubiliac, which is related, though not exactly the same as, the present terracotta. The funerary monument to Handel by Roubiliac is in Westminster Abbey.",
