It has been only in the past few years that the Mu Murray (English [Bray, Berkshire], 1881-1962; resident Rhodesia [now Zimbabwe] 1939-62]).

Quant onverse Allstars designs, each chosen for its significance in the changing history of fashion in the shoe industry.\nRevivalism has been a major theme in the design of twentieth-century shoes. All five of these pairs of shoes demonstrate a nostalgia that is manifest in creating new styles from old. Platforms, although seen as a new style in the 1930s - and subsequently revived in the 1940s, 1970s, and 1990s - had their origins in the chopines of the sixteenth century. The use of synthetics has also become more common in the last century, motivated both by technological innovation and by the scarcity of leather during World War II. Today, synthetics are often seen as an ethical alternative to leather, and companies like Vegetarian Shoes have begun to manufacture design classics - like the \"Doc Martens\" boot - in brightly coloured polyester.\n\nCATHIE DINGWALL",
