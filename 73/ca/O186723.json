Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Goldsmiths in the south of Italy made lavish use of seed pearls, which were abundant in the warm waters of the Mediterranean before the industrial age.  They attached the seed pearls with thin gold wires.  When these broke, as they frequently did, the pearls were lost.  \n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  One of the most popular designs was the girandole, with three drops hanging from a central boss.  This 17th century pattern survived until the end of the 19th century with traditional costume in Italy.  This earring comes from Procida, off the coast of Naples, where the design was known as scorpione, but earrings of this type were made and worn throughout southern Italy.  \n\nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
