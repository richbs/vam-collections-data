Not enough survives for us to understand its original context but it is likely to have formed part of an armorial display. Putti were popular decorative features in post-medieval artworks and are often found on stained glass panels. \n\nThe putto was painted with only a simple brown/black pigment ('grisaille') but parts of the cartouche were painted with enamel colours.\n\nIn the middle of the sixteenth century, new techniques for producing decorated glass were introduced. Glass paints known as 'enamels' were used to paint directly onto the glass; similar to painting onto a canvas. The colours were produced by adding metallic oxides to a glass frit mixture and the resulting colour range included delicate greens and  reds as you see here.\n\nThe Netherlands glass workshops produced a large amount of painted glass. Many of these were commissions from civic, mercantile and church officials within the Netherlands but also from abroad.",
