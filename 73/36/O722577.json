Half of the design is finished, the other half is barely sketched. The frame is vertically aligned.  A large urn with squared handles sits above a palmette on the crest. Husk festoons fall from the handles down the sides. C-scrolls also sit on the crest. The frame features foliage and floral designs. There are leaf scrolls and foliage on the apron.\n\n'No. 9' A design for a circular looking glass. Half of the design is finished, the other half is outlined. The frame features neoclassical moulding. From a bow on the crest flow husk festoons around the sides of the mirror, and are supported to the sides of the mirror by paterae.\n\n'No. 10' A half drawn design for a looking glass, possibly an overmantel. The frame is rectangular, with a curved top and is horizontally aligned. Husk festoons fall from the handles of the urn finial and are supported by acanthus scrolls around the sides.

            "public_access_description": "This design is part of a group of over 900 drawings of frames, mainly for pier glasses, overmantels, and girandoles. Many of these workshop designs share similar characteristics such as leaf scrolls and festoons of husks. Most of them are numbered, contain information about who ordered them, the date, the price (written in code), the colour of the frame and the dimensions of the finished object. \n\nThe drawings from John Linnell's workshop survive over the period 1773 to 1783. From April 1773 to August 1778, the workshop produced about twelve pieces a month. Production decreased over the next two years to 3 or 4 pieces a month. In 1783 these designs were no longer produced.\n\nRobert Adam, a leading architect, was a key influence on the neoclassical designs of John Linnell. Linnell worked with Adam for the first time at Kedleston Hall, Derbyshire, and they worked together on a number of other occasions. In the early 1770s festoons of husks began to be used on pier glasses and they are very prominent within these workshop designs. \n\nJohn Linnell (1729-1796) was the son of the famous furniture maker William Linnell (ca. 1703-1763). Unlike most furniture makers, John Linnell gained a design education at the St. Martin's Lane Academy, which was founded by William Hogarth in 1735. In 1750, aged 21, he joined his father's firm as a designer. On his father's death in 1763, John Linnell took over the family firm. During his lifetime John Linnell produced high quality furniture, which rivalled that of other leading furniture makers such as Thomas Chippendale, John Cobb and William Ince and John Mayhew.",
