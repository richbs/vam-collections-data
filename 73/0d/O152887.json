Wales (where he lived from 1989) and Suffolk were particularly attractive as sources of subject matter for him. \n\nThe Giles Bequest Competition was established with a Bequest left to the Victoria and Albert Museum by an amateur colour printer, art historian and President of the Society of Graver-Printers, William Giles and his partner, the artist Ada Shrimpton. The competition ran throughout the 1950s and became the foundation for the Bradford Print Biennale which ran from 1968 to 1992. The competition was established to encourage experimentation in colour printing. It was administerd by the Museum, which was also responsible for awarding the prizes. Winning entries were usually acquired by the Museum for its permanent collections.",
