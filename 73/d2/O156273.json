There are the remains of an embroidered line across the top. There is a border along the bottom: red blossom with 2 red leaves pointing to the bottom right alternating with a spray of 3 white flowers pointing to the top right. There is a narrow band above and below and extending part way up the sides of the panel: small Y-motifs in red with pink or blue details and above each is a small green triangle.  Looks like a cup or bowl with fruit.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.
