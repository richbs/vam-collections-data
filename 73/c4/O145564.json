Printing started at the bottom and the uppermost row is incomplete. This panel is framed by an inner border with a white and yellow ground decorated with flower heads bracketed by pairs of leaves.\nThe widest border contains a line of fat inward-facing botehs pointing in a clockwise direction, each with a white ground infilled with a flowering spray in three versions.  The field is covered with a red fan-like pattern.  The inner border interrupts the main border to form a square at each corner. These squares contain a diagonal tear-drop shape on the red fan-like pattern and each tear-drop has the same type of infill as the fat botehs.\nThe outer border is a wider version of the yellow and white inner border.  The whole is framed by an plain red border.\nColours: red, blue, yellow, white, black.",
