She was sixty-two years old when she selected this black evening dress. It was called 'Bal Masque' and came from the 1958 spring-summer collection designed by Yves Saint Laurent for the house of Dior. The style of the dress is influenced by the bell-shaped skirts fashionable in the 1860s. This influence can also been seen in the way it has been constructed. This dress has a tightly fitted boned corset and a bell-shaped skirt supported by a layered petticoat.The lightweight overdress is made of a double layer of spotted black tulle. It is studded with sparkling black bugle beads which are arranged in festoons caught at intervals by 42 bows of satin ribbon. The dress buttons down the back.",

            "bibliography": "Mendes, Valerie. <u>Black In Fashion</u>. London: V&A Publications, 1999. p. 75\nThroughout her life the Duchess of Windsor (1896-1986) dressed in an elegant manner, patronising top Paris designers (Dior was a particular favourite).  She was often photographed in pride of place, front row at the collections, and was sixty-two years old when she selected this froth of a black evening gown from Yves Saint Laurent's spring-summer collection for the house of Dior.  Always impeccably groomed, with a youthful appearance and an angular slenderness maintained by careful dieting, she made sure that she always had the very latest mode.  In 'The Windsor Style' (1987), Suzy Menkes gathered evidence of Wallis Simpson's affinity for black, pin-pointing such comments as: 'You have to wear black, ageing or not, because when the little black dress is right, there is nothing else to wear in its place'.  When sketching Mrs Simpson for American Vogue (February 1937), Cecil Beaton wrote: 'My sitter is at her best in a nondescript black dress that she makes smart by wearing'. \nIndicating how slim the Duchess was, this dress has a tiny bodice tapering to a waist measuring 23 inches.  Stylistically, the dress makers reference to 1860s bell-skirted fashions, and there are even some constructional parallels in its cream silk strapless foundation of a tightly fitted, boned corset and a domed skirt supported by a layered petticoat.  Like many late nineteenth and early twentieth-century evening fashions, the frivolous outer shell of swathed tulle, bows and beads has a fragility that belies the firm, highly structured underpinnings.  A symphony in black, the lightweight overdress is a double layer of spotted black tulle, studded with sparkling black bugle beads and arranged in festoons caught  at intervals by forty-two bows of satin ribbon.",
