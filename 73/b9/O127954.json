            "public_access_description": "Gerald Laing is a contemporary artist who began his training at Central St Martin's School of Art in London.  He is one of the British Pop artists of the early 1960s and began his career creating paintings of newspaper photographs of starlets, such as Brigitte Bardot, popular heroes, drag racers and astronauts.  Although these works were painted by hand, they referred directly to printing techniques, such as half tone and silk screen.  Laing's work continued to evolve during the 1960s and the latter part of the decade saw a move towards the abstract, where his work featured skydiver imagery and techniques, such as lacquer, spray paint and electroplating.  In 1969 Laing moved to Scotland with his wife and undertook a project to restore Kinkell Castle, a 16th century ruin.  The landscape of the Highlands proved to be a great influence on Laing's work and from 1969-73 he produced three-dimensional sculptures in response to his surroundings.  Follow Me is an example of how Laing expanded his ideas seen in his earlier three-dimensional works and began to build monuments of fertility and seduction.  Laing established a tapestry workshop in 1970 where Follow Me was woven.",
