It is decorated with an image of a Totem-Pole girl from the successful musical Rose-Marie by Otto Harbach and Oscar Hammerstein Junior, with music by Rudolf Friml and Herbert Stothart, which opened in London at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in March 1925 and ran there for 851 performances. It had previously opened in New York to rave reviews in September 1924. The Redskin Totem-Pole Girls dance that Rose Marie sees near Totem Pole Lodge in Kootenay Pass in the Canadian Rockies, was one of the hits of the spectacular piece.  \n\nTom Smith (1823-1869) started a grocery in London's Goswell Road in 1847and invented crackers as an offshoot of his range of confectionery, cake decorations and fancy goods when he presented sweetmeats wrapped in twists of paper like French 'bon-bons'.  After adding a device to make them bang as they were pulled, Smith's crackers were dubbed Cosaques after the sound of Cossack horse-riders' whips. In the 1920s Tom Smith's crackers were advertised as 'World Renowned Christmas crackers.  No party complete without them.'",
