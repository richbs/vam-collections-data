Trained and worked first as an engraver; according to RE Graves in the DNB, he taught himself to paint in watercolour, aided by practice at the artists' society in Clips tone Street, London. Exhibited eight works at the RA between 1832 and 1870, three at the Br 1839-46, and three at the SBA 1833-7. Subjects mainly the peasantry of Scotland, Ireland, Italy and Spain. Predominantly a painter in watercolour (there are six examples also in the V&A collections); elected Associate of the New Society of Painters in Watercolours 1842, he resigned 1847; elected Member of the Old Watercolour Society 1848. Several illustrations for books, notably Sir Walter Scott's Waverley novels. Friend of Charles Dickens. Several of his works were engraved. Died Cordova, Spain, 31 March 1877. His son, Frank William Warwick Topham, was also an exhibiting painter. \nLIT: \tIllustrated London News 14 April 1877, pp339, 341 (obit, with engr portrait) \n\n\nA Spanish Letter-Writer 485-1882 Neg HF963 \nCanvas, 44.5 X 67.8 cm (17 \u00bd  X 26 \u00bd  ins) Jones Bequest 1882 \nThe notice on the wall above the central figure of the old man reads 'Se escriben cartas y memoriales', advertising his services as a professional letter-writer. Topham first visited Spain in 1852, and later painted several Spanish subjects, including Spanish card players at the RA in 1857. The present work does not seem to have been exhibited. \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
