It could be made in silver and in 1885 a catalogue of the firm's products illustrated a similar elaborately decorated cup costing \u00a3 33. Such a large and heavy item was probably intended for display on the sideboard in either a private home or a public dining room of some elegance. The Midland Grand Hotel at St Pancras station was indeed very stylish. Designed by the architect, Sir George Gilbert Scott, the interior was as richly embellished as the fine eclectic gothic of the facade. The hotel opened in 1873, with plate ordered from Elkingtons, china from the Royal Porcelain Company, Worcester and glass from P.& C. Osler.",

Corner decorated with bunch of beads on top of handle which is decorated as a leaf branch.

It could be made in silver and in 1885 a catalogue of the firm's products illustrated a similar elaborately decorated cup costing \u00a3 33. Such a large and heavy item was probably intended for display on the sideboard in either a private home or a public dining room of some elegance. The Midland Grand Hotel at St Pancras station was indeed very stylish. Designed by the architect, Sir George Gilbert Scott, the interior was as richly embellished as the fine eclectic gothic of the facade. The hotel opened in 1873, with plate ordered from Elkingtons, china from the Royal Porcelain Company, Worcester and  glass from P.&C. Osler. \"",
