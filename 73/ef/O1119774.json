There are about two silk ones the others are silk & mohair - alpaca & bright ally of very lasting quality.  Probably they are good \"middle class\" bought at Peter Robinsons, Duncan Smiths -  Marshall & Snelgrove or Lewis & Allenbys.\"  It is evident from the RF that Miss Reckitt gave no history of the garments, and may well have known none.",
