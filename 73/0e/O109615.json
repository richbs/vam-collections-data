The style of this scrolling decoration is very close to motifs carved in stucco which appear throughout the Court of the Lions.

The abstract form of the capital itself is also very similar to some of the types of capital used in the Palace and Court of the Lions. For a catalogue of the types, see the book by Purificaci\u00f3n Marinetto S\u00e1nchez (<u>Los capiteles del Palacio de los Leones en la Alhambra: ejemplo para el estudio del capitel hispanomusulm\u00e1n y su trascendencia arquitect\u00f3nica : estudio I</u>, Granada, 1996), types 25 to 28. \n\nHowever, the original Museum label for this object states that this capital came from the Palace of the Generalife, the summer palace of the Nasrid Sultans, and also built in the 14th century.

They soon evolved away from their classical roots, though, and developed much more recognisably Islamic characteristics. Among these were increasingly abstract vegetal motifs, as seen in this column capital thought to have come from the Alhambra in Granada.\n\nMade some 600 years after the Muslim conquest of Spain, this capital has a clearly Islamic style. Its basic form is the same as that of earlier capitals, but the acanthus leaves of Roman architecture have by this time become purely abstract shapes.

This part of the Alhambra was built during the second reign of the Nasrid Sultan Muhammad V (1362-1391), and most of the work was done in the early 1370s. However, the original Museum label for this object says that it came from the Palace of the Generalife. Further research needs to be done to find out which palace is meant by this remark.",
