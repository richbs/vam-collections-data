Apprenticed to a heraldic painter in Edinburgh 1806, entered Merchant Navy 1808, Royal Navy 1812, discharged through illness 1814. Worked as scenery painter in London and Edinburgh theatres, painted panoramas and dioramas, as well as easel pictures. Exhibited 135 works at the RA between 1820 and 1867, 22 at the BI 1820-53, and 21 at the SBA 1824-29 (elected Member 1824, President 1829). Subjects almost all marine, river and coastal scenes. Elected to Sketching Society 1829, ARA 1832, RA 1835. Curator of Greenwich Hospital from 1844. Toured the Continent 1830 and 1838-9, and France 1832. Illustrated Heath's 'Picturesque Annuals' (1832, 1833, 1834), published 'Coast Scenery' 1836, and 'Sketches on the Moselle ... ' (1838). Friend of David Roberts RA and Charles Dickens. Died Hampstead, London, 18 May 1867. His son George Clarkson Stanfield was also an artist; his studio sales were at Christie's 8 May 1868 and 23 March 1876. Much admired by Ruskin, his skill at rendering both sea and sky - despite sometimes showing his theatrical interests too clearly - make him, after Turner, the most distinguished marine painter in Britain of the century. \nLIT: \tArt Journal 1857 , pp137-9; Gentleman's Magazine July 1867 (obit); J Dafforne Pictures by Clarkson Stanfield RA nd [1873]; P van der Merwe The Life and Theatrical Career of Clarkson Stanfield Bristol University PhD thesis 1979, and The Spectacular Career of Clarkson Stanfield Tyne and Wear County Council Museums exhibition catalogue 1979 (with bibliography) \n\nOn the Rhine, Near Cologne\n FA188 \nCanvas, 106.7 X 87.7 cm (42 X 341/2 ins) Signed and dated 'C.

He exhibited 'Cologne on the Rhine' at the SBA 1826 (84), possibly the painting now in the Rheinisches Landesmuseum, Bonn ('The Rhine at Cologne' 113 X 168 cm/441/2 X 66 ? ins, repr in van der Merwe's catalogue, p94), which was engraved in 1828. A watercolour copy of the present work was part of lot 168 sold at Christie's 5 June 1930. A similar view was engraved by J T Willmore for Charles Heath's Picturesque Annual 1833, p164 (impr in V&A collections E 879-1918). \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
