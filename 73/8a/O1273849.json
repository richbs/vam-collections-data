The Amphitheatre had a stage with a proscenium arch in addition to the circus ring and the two were interlinked by ramps so that the horses could run on to the stage from the ring. This was an ingenious design, which heightened the possibilities for tricks and dramatic effect.\n\nUnfortunately the wooden building was lit by candles , which was a terrible fire hazard. The circus burnt down again in 1803. In 1804 Astley\u2019s was rebuilt for a third time. Each time the theatre was rebuilt the interior became more ornate. Astley also ensured that the stages were strengthened to take the weight of more horses and increase the dramatic potential of his acts. He continued to collect new acts from home and abroad. Clowns, ropewalkers and tumblers complemented the equestrian entertainment.\n\nIn 1824 the management of Philip Astley\u2019s Amphitheatre was taken over by Andrew Ducrow. Equestrian dramas such as 'Mazeppa', 'The Courier of St Petersburg' and 'Ivanhoe' became very popular.
