Studied at Sass's art school and entered RA Schools 1819. Exhibited 118 works at the RA between 1823 and 1862 (won gold medal 1825), 68 (including a sculpture) at the BI 1823-59, and 28 (including watercolours) at the SBA 1825-39. Painted portraits, but mainly biblical, historical and mythological subjects. Won competition for the altarpiece of St James's, Bermondsey (The Ascension') 1844. Several paintings were engraved. Died 19 April 1870; the sale of his collection and his own works was at Christie's 16-18 February 1872 (the catalogue has biographical notes). \nLIT: Art Journal 1870, p204 (obit); Redgrave Diet \n\nHead of a Lady (After T Lawrence)\n375-1872 Neg HF971 \nCanvas, circular, diameter 40.6 cm (16 ins) Purchased 1872 \nThe head is taken from a large three-quarter-length portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence of 'Lady Selina Meade' (later Countess Clam-Martinics) exhibited at the RA in 1820 (collection Earl of Clanwilliam; K Garlick Sir Thomas Lawrence 1954, p50, repr pl 85). It was engraved by C Heath for the frontispiece of the 1828 Keepsake, and by G T Doo in 1835. According to the Christie's sale catalogue of 16 February 1872, Wood as a student at the RA 'obtained the notice of Fuseli and Sir Thomas Lawrence, and under the auspices of the latter he commenced his career in art'. There were several copies after old and modern masters in that sale, including a few after Lawrence portraits. See also 'Head of a Lady', (374-1872, above). \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
