The basic form of knives and forks had also become standardised by this date.\n\nDesign & Designing\nBy the mid-18th century, table knives and forks were usually made in sets and decorated to match the rest of the cutlery.  By the end of the 18th century the standard pistol-shaped haft (handle) gave way to straighter, flat-ended hafts. Forks generally had smaller hafts. The knife blade is usually of sabre, or scimitar, shape. The steel blades and shanks have a 'tang' or rod at the base that fits into the hollow handle, which is then packed with resin. The junction between haft and blade is fitted with a small metal collar, or 'ferrule'.\n\nMaterials & Making\nPorcelain hafts were introduced into Europe from China, and the subsequent demand stimulated the production of ceramic hafts at many European factories. The Staffordshire pottery factories produced solid 'agate ware' (pottery intended to look like agate) and 'marbled agate ware' hafts.",
