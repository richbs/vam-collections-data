New patterns and colours are released every season, based around the two enduring designs: classic and pleated. Not surprisingly, given the company's equestrian roots, the 'formal bridle' pattern seen here, is a recurrent theme and has become part of Herm\u00e8s's signature look. Combining elegant lines, cool classicism and whimsical patterns, these silk scarves have come to signify the refined luxury for which Herm\u00e8s is known. \n\nThis particular scarf was not produced for retail distribution; it was part of a limited edition of scarves woven and printed with an invitation to the re-opening of the Herm\u00e8s branch in Geneva.
