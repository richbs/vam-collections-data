            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 198, 200, 201\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n \n\"This sketch, together with Nos. 17-20 [42-1873, 43-1873 44-1873, 45-1873], were the only drawings by Constable in the Museum before the gifts made by Miss Isabel Constable in 1888.  It was purchased from Messrs. Hogarth and Sons in May 1876.\nOn laid paper, mounted on thin card; as the paper is thin and much scraped with the knife by the artist in various <i>pentimenti</i>, the drawing has not been removed for the inspection on the back.\n\nNo. 331 [261-1876] is closely connected with the oil sketch No. 330 [150-1888] and still more closely with the published state of the mezzotint 'Stoke by Neyland' by David Lucas (S. 9).  It has a stylistic affinity with the late sepia and monochrome drawings Nos. 410-414 [249-1888, 250-1888, 248-1888, 816-1888, 603-1888]and is a studio composition rather than a study from nature.  The drawing seems to have been used for the arrangement of the cottages round the church tower in the mezzotint, and if it was prepared for that purpose must have been made before December 1830 (S.:L., p. 167).  The church tower itself on the other hand does not represent that at Stoke-by-Nayland, being lower, squatter and with different fenestration.  The mezzotint is more true to the original in this respect.  Shirley (S.:L., p. 168; L. ed. S., p. 339) regards the rainbow effect of the published state as borrowed from No. 331 [261-1876]; but though the details are vague the feature in questions appears in the drawing to be a rim of light behind a hill, and the impression is given of a moonlit scene with a full moon in the sky. The hill, if it be such, is not topographically exact, and does not appear in any of the stages of the print. This drawing may have been made when there was some intention of generalizing the scene into that of any church in any village. Constable does in fact refer to the plate at an early stage as 'The Church' (S.: L., p. 21; see also Davies, pp. 31-2).\"\nHon. A.
