The pattern of intertwined leafing and flowering stems with pairs of birds was designed by Sidney Mawson. Mawson was a free-lance textile and wallpaper designer who, in the early years of the 20th century, had considerable success producing finely drawn naturalistic patterns in clear bright colours, such as this. \n\nAs with most of Liberty's printed fabrics, this fabric was manufactured by an outside firm, to be sold in the London store as a Liberty fabric, without mention of the designer or manufacturer. This example was produced by the Lancashire firm of Turnbull & Stockdale Ltd. The firm was established in Ramsbottom, Lancashire in 1881, and their hand block-printed textiles are some of the most interesting of the late 19th and early 20th century.",
