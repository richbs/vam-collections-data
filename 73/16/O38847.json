The front shows a boy and girl in a country landscape, under a tree with a sheep: the girl wears a blue dress and carries a lamb in her arms, and the boy (visible on the inside) has a yellow shirt and grey shorts and carries a sheaf of lavender.  The wording, printed on a rectangle of gold foil, reads\nYOU'RE 8 TODAY\nwith\nBirthday Wishes (on the inside) to the right.  On the inside of the card the boy becomes a pop-out figure, with a thatched cottage across a field in the background; the verse reads:\nThe nicest kind of wishes\nFor a jolly day all through\nFill up this Birthday greeting\nSent specially for you.",
