At this time, graphic art was heavily used to promote mass campaigns and divulgate revolutionary ideas. \n\nThe theme of this poster is to celebrate the patriotic and heroic spirit of the soldiers belonging to the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the military organisation of the People's Republic of China. The PLA was a later development of the Red Army, founded in 1927, and under the Mao regime was invested of a strong political and social role. Propaganda posters before the 1980s often depict the sacrifices of the PLA soldiers as a means to mobilise the masses and educate people to revolutionary ideals.",
