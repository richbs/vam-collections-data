Even the standard repeating patterns of this moulding are expertly carved and the design is heightened in places with gilding. This use of 'parcel' or partial gilding was an English fashion.  In France, and some other European countries, such mouldings would have been fully gilded, standing out against the painted ground.\n\nIt is one of several hundred carvings given to the Museum in 1921 by Sir Charles Allom and his wife, in memory of their son, who died in the First World War. Sir Charles headed one of the most successful firms of architectural decorators in Britain, specialising in the copying of historic styles. Between 1900 and 1914 he also began to work for clients in the United States and after the First World War he spent time in both countries.  The collection of carvings seems to have been put together as a study collection for his son, perhaps in the expectation that he would follow in his father's footsteps and take over the firm.",
