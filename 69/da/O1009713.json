            "public_access_description": "The decorations at Chirk Castle were one of Pugin's and Crace's major undertakings together. In their accounts for 1847, the work done at Chirk came to \u00a32650. Pugin received \u00a3132 10s. 0d.. Pugin produced plans for the interior of the east side of the castle from 1846 to 1848. He provided designs for the Long Gallery, entrance hall and 18th-century reception rooms in the north wing; Pugin's only attempt at decorating classical rooms. His schemes have not survived.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
