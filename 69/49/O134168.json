            "public_access_description": "Lodovico Caracciolo (1761-1842) was a Roman painter and engraver who specialised in panoramic views and architectural drawings of his native city. The term 'panorama' describes several forms of large-scale pictorial entertainment that enjoyed widespread popularity in the 19th century. The term was devised for a 360\u00b0 view painted on the inside of a large cylinder and viewed from a platform at its centre, an exhibition technique invented in 1787 by Robert Barker (1739-1806), an Irish artist working in Edinburgh. This enabled the paintings to be displayed under carefully controlled conditions to foster an illusion of reality, drawing upon traditions of illusionistic decorative painting, topographical prospects and contemporary theatrical sets. The popularity of Barker's circular paintings inspired imitators around the world. By the 1880s the panorama had spread throughout Europe and North America and became big business, financed by joint-stock companies and standardized in size to facilitate production and touring. By the end of the century however the panorama had largely run its course.\nIn the V&A canvas, Caracciolo depicts the Eternal City appears from a high viewpoint looking down, as if viewed from the top of the Palatine hill. The foreground is filled with lush vegetation, fields and shepherds with their flocks, which give way to views of some of Rome's most famous monuments and ruins, from the Campidoglio to the Tarpean Rock. The bright blue sky transforms into a yellow-pink sunset and enhances the illusionism. In 1831, Caracciolo made an aquatint panorama of the city of Rome after this painting, joining six prints to create the final view.",

CARACCIOLO (active first half 19th century) \nItalian School \nRecorded primarily as an engraver. \n \n46 \nPANORAMA OF ROME \nSigned, and dated lower left <i>L. Caracciolo Roma 1824</i>\nCanvas \n5 ft 6 in. x 43 ft 10 in. (167.7 x 1335.8) \n1292-1886 \nNot reproduced \n\nThe term 'panorama' was used from about 1790 to describe a circular painting shown so that the spectator, standing on a platform in the middle, could encompass the whole by turning a full 360 degrees. The illusion of reality was maintained, because the spectator could see nothing except the panorama within the rotunda built specially for displaying works of this kind. In this example the two extremities - on the right St Peter's, on the left the Forum and the Colosseum - were presumably joined together. An engraved key entitled <i>Panorama des Environs de Rome,</i> which was received with the painting, does not appear to tally with it in detail. \nThe first patent of a panorama was taken out in 1787 by Robert Barker, an otherwise little-known painter from Edinburgh. In 1787-88 he showed his first panorama, a View of Edinburgh, at Holyrood and Glasgow and subsequently, in 1789, at 28 the Haymarket, London. In 1800 panoramas were established in Paris and Berlin and they remained popular until well into the second half of the 19th century.  \nA Panorama of Rome was shown at the Colosseum in Regents Park (built by Decimus Burton in 1824-29) not long after its opening in the late 1820s, but, apart from the coincidence in date, there is no evidence that this panorama may be identified with 1292-1886 (see G. Bapst, <i>Essai sur l'histoire des panoramas et des dioramas,</i> 1891, p. 27). \n\nCondition. The canvas has worn through in several places, but on the whole the condition is reasonably good. \nProv. The Rev. Sir V. D.

Vyvyan, Bt., 1886\n\nHistorical significance: Lodovico Caracciolo (1761-1842) was a Roman painter and engraver who specialised in panoramic views and architectural drawings of his native city. In the V&A canvas, the Eternal City appears from a high viewpoint looking down, as if viewed from the top of the Palatine hill. The foreground is filled with lush vegetation, fields and shepherds with their flocks, which give way to views of some of Rome's most famous monuments and ruins, from the Campidoglio to the Tarpean Rock. The bright blue sky transforms into a yellow-pink sunset and enhances the illusionism. In 1831, Caracciolo made an aquatint panorama of the city of Rome after this painting, joining six engraved prints to create the final view.",

The term was devised for a 360\u00b0 view painted on the inside of a large cylinder and viewed from a platform at its centre, an exhibition technique invented in 1787 by Robert Barker (1739-1806), an Irish artist working in Edinburgh. This enabled the paintings to be displayed under carefully controlled conditions to foster an illusion of reality, drawing upon traditions of illusionistic decorative painting, topographical prospects and contemporary theatrical sets. The popularity of Barker's circular paintings inspired imitators around the world. By the 1880s the panorama had spread throughout Europe and North America and became big business, financed by joint-stock companies and standardized in size to facilitate production and touring. By the end of the century however the panorama had largely run its course.",
