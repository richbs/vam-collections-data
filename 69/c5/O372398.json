This example, made in 1798, is fitted with six courses of double strings, like Spanish instruments of this period. However, the shape of the body and rosette, and the internal structure, anticipate the 'Romantic guitar', a version with six strings, a smallish body and light sound, which was highly fashionable throughout Europe from about 1815 until the early 1860s.",
