            "public_access_description": "The name zircon comes from the Arabic 'zargoon', meaning golden coloured. However, zircons are also found in a range of greens and browns. The lustrous colours of zircon used in jewellery are often produced by heating brown zircon. Heating the stones in an oxygen-free atmosphere produces blue zircon, which may then be heated in air to create a golden colour. Zircon displays a lustre and dispersion (fire) that rival those of diamond. Historically, colourless zircon has been used as a diamond substitute. However, although hard, it is very brittle and closer examination usually reveals damage to the surface and the facet edges. There is also a high level of double refraction, not found in diamonds. This can be seen under magnification as the back facets appear doubled.\n\nThis ring forms part of a collection of 154 gems bequeathed to the V&A by the Reverend Chauncy Hare Townshend, a cleric and poet. Sir A. H. Church gave additional specimens in 1913. He also compiled the first catalogue Precious Stones: A Guide to the Townshend Collection. The first edition appeared in 1883. The stones are mounted as rings, although they may not have been intended to be worn.",

Although the collection is not as comprehensive as that found at the Natural History Museum, it is of particular historic interest as its formation pre-dates the development of many synthetic gemstones and artificial enhancements. All the stones were mounted as rings before they came to the Museum, mainly in a series of standardised gold settings, often of the coronet or galleried type. However, several specimens are set with greater elaboration, with diamond borders surrounding the central stone. Some of these were originally in the possession of Henry Philip Hope (d.1839), a brother of the novelist and antiquary Thomas Hope (c. 1770-1831). H.P. Hope formed a famous collection of diamonds and precious stones which was largely inherited by his three nephews. His collection, which included the Hope blue diamond, now in the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, was catalogued by B. Hertz in 1839. \nTownshend is recorded as having made purchases from it and his acquisitions are noted below. He also seems to have remounted several of his purchases, in whole or in part.",
