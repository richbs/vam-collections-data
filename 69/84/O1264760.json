The design is printed onto a sheet of tissue paper or a thin pliable layer of gelatin (animal glue), by means of which it is then transferred onto the surface of the ware.\n\nThe technique was in use at Birmingham in 1751, though it appears to have been practised at the Doccia factory near Florence in the previous decade. 18th-century transfers were made from both paper and pliable sheets of animal glue (or gelatin), but only paper transfers could be used for printing 'blue and white wares'. Transfer-printing transformed the British market in the 19th century for brightly decorated, cheap earthenwares of many shapes and sizes. Gelatin transfers were superseded by tissue paper and the output of the potteries in Staffordshire increased substantially. This type of work is best exemplified by the familiar 'Willow Pattern' however the variety of shapes and designs produced by the Staffordshire potteries were vast.\n\nThis dessert plate is decorated with the 'Mandarin Opaque Series' pattern, possibly by Minton (one example exists with the  impressed seal mark ' Improved Stone China' which  suggests the series was made by Minton c.1825-35).",
