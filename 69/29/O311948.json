It was the last of the great Jacobite risings - the popular attempts to restore the House of Stuart with a monarch to the throne of Britain.   \n\nThe Prince William, Duke of Cumberland (1721-1765) was a younger son of George II of Great Britain and Caroline of Ansbach. His role in putting down the Jacobite Rising at the Battle of Culloden is the role he is mostly remembered for although he continued to pursue a successful military career.",
