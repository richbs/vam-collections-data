He work with Robert Adam in England in the 1760s and travelled to the West Indies in 1770. He is best known for his drawings that constitute an important record of life in the Lesser Antilles in the second half of the 18th century.\n\nThis painting is part of a set of five paintings commissioned to Agostino Brunias by Robert Adam to decorate the Breakfast Room at Kedleston Hall. Adam executed the design and Brunias was entrusted with the execution of the painting. It shows two women, probably vestals or ancient priestesses, in classical dress two women in classical dress in a landscape, one standing, one seated, each side of a square altar surmounted with an urn of flowers. This painting imitates classical mural decoration which came into fashion at the end of the 18th century.",

Adam's preparatory sketches are currently in Sir John Soane's Museum, London.\nThe present painting shows two women in classical dress in a landscape, one standing, one seated, each side of a square altar surmounted with an urn of flowers. They are probably two vestals, virgin priestesses of the Ancient Roman religion, highly regarded and respected for there devotion and purity. \nThis painting derived from the antique ornaments of the thermal baths of Diocletian, the largest public baths in Rome, built in the 4th century AD. Adam's thematic was probably inspired by the 'Athenian' Stuart's Painted Room at Spencer House, and illustrated the care for domestic virtues women. In fact, the painted Breakfast Room began life as 'Lady's caroline Dressing Room'. \nBrunias tried to reproduce the fresco technique on canvas by painting 'a la detrempe' but this poor medium mostly made of water unfortunately deteriorated quickly over the years. The room was eventually dismantled in 1807 and Brunias' paintings in their original frame survived in the house until 1960s when they were removed and stored by the late Lord Scarsdale before being eventually sold to the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1975.",

            "historical_context_note": "[Decorative painting] Neo-classicism succeeded to Rococo in the second half of the 18th century. It was stimulated by the archaeological rediscovery of the Roman and Greek antique civilisations and domestic life, especially at Herculaneum from 1738 and Pompeii from 1748. This revived interest for the Antique lifestyle was witnessed in the fine arts by the choice of subject matters inspired by the Antique heroes such as Jacques-Louis David's <i>Andromache Mourning Hector</i> and the <i>Oath of the Horatii</i> (both in Louvre, Paris), which exalted republican heroism.\nIn the applied and decorative arts, this taste gave birth to furnished interiors that combined Greek and Roman decorative and architectural sources in such examples as James Stuart's Painted Room in Spencer House, London (1759) and sought-after designs by Robert Adam which were circulating thanks to the publication of <i>Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam</i> (London, 1773-9). Neo-classicism eventually became in France the official mode during the Napoleonic age.",
