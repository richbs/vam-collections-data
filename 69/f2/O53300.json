This lavish suite was designed to show off the taste and wealth of the owner, and would probably have been used in a drawing room, one of the most expensively furnished rooms of a house. The floral tapestry covers date from the 18th century, although the under-upholstery is modern.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe chair was almost certainly supplied by Richard Wright and Edward Elwick of Wakefield, Yorkshire, who were working between 1745 and 1771. They were the pre-eminent firm of cabinet-makers and upholsterers in Yorkshire at that time. Richard Wright may have directed the Soho tapestry factory in London before moving to Wakefield, thus providing the firm with expertise in the use of tapestry. The chair frame is carved with fish scales and acanthus leaves, and gilt, for a very opulent effect.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe suite was made for William Wentworth, 4th Earl of Strafford (1722-1791), for Wentworth Castle, Yorkshire.  There is a bill dating from 1746 for chairs and a sofa from the firm of Wright & Elwick. The Duchess of Northumberland  wrote that she saw 'French chairs emb'd [embroidered] with flowers upon Brown by the famous Mr Wright' when she visited Wentworth Castle in 1760. She was probably referring to these chairs, mistaking the woven tapestry for embroidery.",
