The square toe has been exaggerated to droop over the sole at both corners.  Typical of the late 17th century is the white rand, the narrow band of white leather between the sole and the upper.\n\nSuch decorative footwear would have belonged to a lady of leisure. Slippers were usually backless; they were informal footwear and would have been worn indoors, probably with a nightgown.\n\nDespite their informality, slippers were often highly decorated.  The exquisite embroidery on this example consists of a series of flowers, berries and leaves, worked in blue and red silk thread, with branches and additional leaves and berries in silver thread.  Prominent down the centre front are raised motifs in silver-gilt and silver thread, worked over a firm, padded wool foundation.",
