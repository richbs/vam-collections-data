The handles on most feather fans are normally made of wood or bamboo, but occasionally, carved ivory and jades were used by those in wealthier situations. \n\nThis brightly coloured feathered fan, made in modern times, was possibly made under the influence of Western fashions in the early twentieth century, when accessories made of real feathers were in vogue. At the same time, the design of this fashionable accessory bears references to Chinese antiquity, in the form of a hardstone or glass handle carved with geometric patterns reminiscent of ancient bronzes. \n\nThe fan might have been made or imported for the consumption of fashionable Chinese women exposed to current trends from Europe and America in the early twentieth century; alternatively, it is also possible that this was an accessory designed and made in China in response to the demands and tastes of women from expatriate communities who kept in touch with fashionable developments in the metropolis.",

He married Alexandra (b. Corfu 4 Feb. 1880; d. Brussels 1961) whose mother was Angelia n\u00e9e Calvocoressi and who chose the family name Comn\u00ffne, in Brussels in 1913. Alexandra accompanied her husband in his foreign postings to Peking between 1910-16 and again in 1920-24, Berlin 1924-31 and Madrid 1932-29 after which the couple resided in Brussels. Together they formed collections of Mexican armour, Mexican textiles, Puebla ceramics, Spanish colonial glass; Chinese textiles, Chinese and Japanese lacquer, Chinese furniture, ceramics and metalwork; and they preserved inherited period lace.\n\nParts of these collections have been acquired by museums internationally:\nThe British Museum: Mexican textiles and beadwork (1994 AM3.1, AM7.1-20; 1996 AM10 1-18; 1997 AM4.1)\nMexico City, Franz Mayer Museum: Mexican rebosos and textiles (1994 AD-004, AD-020;DRA-0009, DRA-0025; AD-021, AD-030; DCH-0001, DCH-0010; AD-031, AD-038; DFB-007, DFB-0014); Ecclesiastical embroidered panels, XVI century (2002 09157-01966; DCN-0013, FCF-0011-15; FPA-0013-16)\n\nAlexandra Comn\u00ffne-Everts was herself a proficient artist and designer.
