In 1935 his son Charles Goldsmith entered the firm with the aim of making glasses a fashion item. From the company\u2019s offices in Poland Street, his sons A. Oliver and Ray Goldsmith built upon the company\u2019s reputation for attention-grabbing designs and solicited celebrity endorsement for their products. Key clients included Lord Snowdon, the actress Diana Dors, Princess Grace of Monaco and Diana, Princess of Wales. \n\nA. Oliver Goldsmith created this frame, titled \u2018Union Jack\u2019 in the mid-1960s, a time when the plastic was still cut and shaped by hand in the company workshop. The application of the thin plastic panel, painted with an image of the British flag, was also done by hand and was secured to the plastic frame by tiny screws. Though whimsical, this design is potentially wearable and it received much press attention at the time.",
