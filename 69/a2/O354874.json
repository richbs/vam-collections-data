The neck-opening is bordered at back and front with a row of circles containing alternately an animal or an eight-pointed star with five dancing figures below an arcade.  Foliations fill the arches and over them is a row of pointed compartments enclosing circular devices; in some of the spandrels is an animal or a bird.  The square panels on the shoulders, and at both back and front near the lower edge, contain eight-pointed stars surrounded by borders of animals and birds in circles.\nThe yellow wool is only used for details of the pattern.
