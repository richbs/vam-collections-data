            "public_access_description": "This small box has been decorated using the intricate technique of piqu\u00e9 which was perfected in Paris in the 18th century. It required skilled craftsmen to inlay turtle shell (now known as tortoiseshell) with tiny gold pins (known as piqu\u00e9 point) or strips of gold in shallow grooves (piqu\u00e9 pos\u00e9). \n\nThe stripe-pattern on this example has been engine-turned, a technique first found on boxes from Paris and London around 1750. The top is decorated with mother-of-pearl stained green and pink and with floral sprigs cut from a single gold sheet. The rim and hinge are gilt-bronze.",
