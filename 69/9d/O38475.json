The certificate is headed \"SCHEDULE III/ Local Education Authority---Leeds---/ LABOUR CERTIFICATE, No.1(a) (for total exemption after 13 years of age).\", and is divided into two parallel sections, both stamped with the signature of James Graham, a Local Education Authority officer.  The left-hand one gives the holder's name (Annie Waggonheim), address (50 Regent Street) and birthdate (11/10/1901), and certifies that she is not less than thirteen years old acording to her birth certificate (see B.22-1995) or statutory declaration.  The right-hand section certifies that she has made 350 attendances in not more than two schools during each year for five preceding years, and gives 'Darley St C School' (Darley Street Council School) as the school in which the attendances were made.",
