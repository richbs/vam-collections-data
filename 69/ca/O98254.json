The wedding was a Jewish ceremony which took place in the Masonic Rooms in Huddersfield. The Jewish community in Huddersfield was very small at the time and the marriage formalities fell under the auspices of the Leeds congregation. A wedding under the Chuppah (canopy) could take place anywhere.\n\nDr Compton wore this hat with a dark suit, lighter waistcoat, silk necktie, leather gloves and spats. His wife was dressed in an elegant white silk dress, a lace veil trimmed with flowers, and she carried a huge bouquet of roses. The brush and pad would have been used to clean the hat and keep the pile smooth and dust free. They are stored with the hat in a tall oblong box to protect them.",
