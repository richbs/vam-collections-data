The washstand is part of a suite of furniture that he designed for the guest bedroom at 78 Derngate, Northampton.  Mackintosh was commissioned by Mr W. J. Bassett-Lowke, a scale model manufacturer, to renovate the house for him and his prospective bride in 1916. In addition to the washstand there was also a dressing-table and stool, two chairs, a luggage stool, towel rail, bedside cupboard, twin beds and a hanging mirror. The suite was later reproduced for Bassett-Lowke's friends Mr and Mrs Sydney Horstmann at their house in Bath in 1917.  In about 1920 the dark mahogany suite was replaced with lighter, brighter oak furnishings of a different design.",
