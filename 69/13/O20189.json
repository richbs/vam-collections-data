Charles Henry Bennett drew on wood for this engraving to be made by a wood-engraver.\n\nThere are three vertical, sharp creases which are evident on both sides of the sheet of paper.  One crease only extends up to the side of the bottom illustration.  The two long, vertical creases are crossed by two horizontal ones above and below each illustration,  These creases may have been used to line up the illustrations with the border E.924-1998. \n\n'Emblem VII' 'Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?' - JOB XIII. 24",
