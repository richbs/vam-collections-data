He worked on radio and the variety theatre circuit during the 1950s, becoming a well-paid star with star billing by the mid 1950s. His ability to improvise on stage was extraordinary and led to his soubriquet 'Ken Dodd the Unpredictable'. His first break in pantomime came at the Bradford Alhambra in 1959, and he became widely known through television in the 1960s where his 'Diddy Men' and 'Tickling Stick' became a trademark of his act.\n\nTessie O\u2019Shea, singer, dancer and ukulele player, appeared on the variety circuits from the age of 11 and first sang her \u2018signature\u2019 song \u2018Two-ton Tessie from Tennessee\u2019 at the age of 15 at the Hippodrome Blackpool. In 1944 she shared top billing at the London Palladium with Max Miller, and in 1949 toured with Billy Cotton and his band in Tess and Bill.",
