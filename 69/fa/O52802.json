Glass was not available at the full size, so large mirrors are usually made of two pieces, one for the longer lower section and a separate shaped piece for the upper. Elaborately coloured glass or tooled giltwood borders emphasized the spectacular effect that such larger mirrors gave to an interior.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe glass border was decorated on the back by applying gold leaf, engraving a pattern in the gold and then applying a layer of blue paint to fill the pattern. This was called 'mosaic work'. It was later given the name verre \u00e9glomis\u00e9, after the Parisian picture framer Jean-Baptiste Glomy (died around 1786).  The ornamental pattern used here is close to the engravings of Jean Berain (died 1711), court designer to Louis XIV (ruled 1643-1715). The figures in the lower borders represent Flora, the classical goddess of flowers,  and her husband  Zephyr, the west wind of springtime.\n\nPeople\nThe mirror may have been made in the workshop of Thomas Pelletier (born 1680, died after 1725) and Ren\u201a Pelletier (active 1681, died  1726), sons of Jean Pelletier, a Huguenot (French Protestant \u201amigr\u201a) carver and gilder from Paris. Their workshop was in Covent Garden, London. In 1707 the Pelletier brothers provided Ralph, 1st Duke of Montagu with verre \u00e9glomis\u00e9 overmantels for Ditton House, Buckinghamshire.\n\n",
