            "public_access_description": "When the First World War began in 1914, the British Parliamentary Recruiting Committee (PRC) commissioned posters to encourage men to enlist in the armed forces. Frank Pick, the commercial manager of the Underground Electric Railways who subsequently gained a historic reputation for setting high standards in advertising graphics, refused to hang the PRC's posters in his stations because of their poor design. Instead he commissioned Frank Brangwyn and Gerald Spencer Pryse. This design by Brangwyn was considered too horrific by the War Office and it asked that the poster be withdrawn. However, it drew such huge numbers of recruits that the War Office relented.",
