A little horned pendant made of silver and two hearts are attached to the chains, and another plaque is stamped 'Lucky Devil'. Hans Stofer has written that 'My thinking and research is driven by the interdisciplinary world of everyday objects and what they are made from. I am particularly fascinated by the mundane and discarded and their potential as carrier for Meaning and Purpose.' Characteristically the necklace is composed partly of ready-made mundane elements, two kinds of industrial chain, of which one is re-used. Stofer describes the necklace as 'totally unbling, but the size of bling', and as having 'a narrative, unlike bling'.\n\nHans Stofer was born in Baden, Switzerland, in 1957. He was the son of a turbine engineer and took his first degree in Precision Engineering at Brown Boveri Technical College, followed by a master's degree in Jewellery and Design from Zurich School of Art and Design. He has been course leader in Silversmithing, Metalwork and 3D Design at Camberwell College of Arts (University of the Arts, London) and is currently Professor in the Department of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the Royal College of Art, London.",
