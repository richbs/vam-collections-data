Pieces without any decoration at all are the most commen, but small quantities with incised designs and motifs in relief, as seen here, and open-work were also made. \nThis 18th-century bluish-white glazed bottle is decorated on all four sides with carved low-relief  designs of  crane, deer, pine, bamboo, tortoise and clouds. On the shoulder of the bottle are bats. These motifs are all thought to be auspicious and were very popular not only on ceramics but also on metalwares, textiles and paintings. Pine trees and bamboo, for example, remain green and resist the extremes of weather, thus suggesting durability and long life.",
