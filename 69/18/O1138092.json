It was not only the film that became a success but also the mechandising that was produced along side the film. The films captured the public's imagination and paved the way for the merchandising that accompanies many films today. A whole host of toy figures, spacecrafts and vehicles were available, as well as costumes, stationery, bedroom accessories and slippers.\n\nThis figure of robot R2-D2 is from Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith.  There is a picture on the left hand side of the package of the character from the film who was played by Kenny Baker. The actor could not be seen as he was inside the robot.",
