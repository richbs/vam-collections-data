The text is written in black ink in Prakrit, seven lines to the page between red and gold marginal rules and blue border decoration. The text of a Sanskrit commentary is inserted in small Nagari characters in the margins. Central and marginal string-holes are decorated but not pierced and on the obverse of each folio the central hole only is marked. Folio numbers are written in the lower right-hand corner of the reverse of each folio but are defective from folio 85 onwards due to insect damage. The colophon is written in red on f.92 verso (see Marks).\nThe folio recto shows the fourteen dreams of Rani Trishala with the goddess Shri, who was one of the dreams, in the centre wearing a pink blouse and holding two lotuses in the upper two of her four arms. Illustration on the right of the page in gold, red, pink, black and white on a blue rectangular background framed on three sides. The remainder of the page is occupied by text and marginal decorations.",

            "public_access_description": "The Kalpasutra (Book of Rituals) is the most important canonical text in Jain literature for the Svetambaras (white-clad), one of the two sects of Jainism. Jainism is one of the oldest religions to have survived until the present time and its basic teaching is one of non-violence.  The Kalpasutra is divided into three sections. The first section deals with the lives of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirthankaras, who were the Jain spiritual teachers or 'ford-makers'.  The second part deals with the life of Mahavira, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara. The third part deals with rules for the ascetics and laws during the four months (chaturmas) of the rainy season, when ascetics temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst the laity. This is the time when the festival of Paryushan is celebrated and the Kalpasutra is traditionally recited.\nThe folio shows the fourteen auspicious dreams of Rani Trishala,  who was to become the mother of Mahavira. In the centre is depicted the goddess Shri, who was one of the dreams, wearing a pink blouse and holding two lotuses in the upper two of her four arms. The goddess Shri, sometimes also known as Lakshmi, is worshipped by both Hindus and Jains and is associated with good fortune. The other dreams include an elephant, a bull, a lion, the moon, the sun, a full vase, and other objects. Rani Trishala dreamed the fourteen dreams after the embryo of Mahavira was transferred into her womb as she slept, on the orders of Indra (Shakra), king of the gods, as she was considered to be a suitable mother for the twenty-fourth Jina.",
