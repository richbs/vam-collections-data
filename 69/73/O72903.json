It is a full length garment with high slits at the sides, 3/4 length sleeves and a small high collar. It is right side fastening with three loop and knot buttons, press studs and a hidden zip at the side seam. There are seams across the shoulders and a dart at the top of the sleeves to accommodate shoulder pads in the 1980s style. All the edges are trimmed with bias-cut pale grey satin and the garment has a synthetic lining.",

She and her husband were posted to the UK in the 1990s and she took an interest in the acquisition of Chinese dress in the V&A. She herself always wore a <i>qipao</i> on formal and semi-formal occasions and, although she often purchased the material in Europe ( for example, she liked Liberty wool), she had them tailored in Taiwan.  She owned many different kinds and found them suitable for the diplomatic life.  She was able to wear sleeveless cotton <i>qipao</i> in hot climates and woolen ones in cooler parts of the world.  She explained how the <i>qipao</i> was not unchanging but responded to small fashion notes. The exmaple here could only be from the 1980s with its big shoulders. Mrs Chien was instrumental in helping the museum acquire a <i>qipao</i> from Madame Chiang Kai-shek, see FE.112-1996\n\nHistorical significance: This <i>qipao</i> was worn by Mrs Chien, the wife of the Representative of Taiwan to Great Britain, on formal occasions in the 1980s.",
