            "public_access_description": "On the 9th of April 1989 the independent trade union Solidarity gained permission to take part in parliamentary elections to be held on the 4th of June of the same year. This left very little time to prepare an election campaign. Despite its popularity, Solidarity had no professional staff to take charge of the campaign and no funds for it. As a result, a great deal of the campaign was conducted spontaneously. Following the pattern developed during Solidarity\u2019s period of underground activity, any unprofessional means of expression were welcome. The poster \u2018Vote for Solidarity\u2019 is both a good example of the amateur election poster and an image of the spontaneous citizen-based campaign for the benefit of Solidarity.\n\nSolidarity, founded in September 1980, was the first free trade union in an Eastern Bloc country. It became the leading political force opposing the communist regime in Poland. Eventually the Polish Government was forced to negotiate with the Solidarity-led opposition, resulting in semi-free elections on 4th June 1989. This marked a crucial stage in the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe.",
