This candlestick is formed by three kneeling cupids, connected by garlands, upholding a vase-shaped pillar decorated with masks and strap work.\n\nThe object was bought by the Museum from the Soulages Collection. Jules Soulages was a collector of French and Italian Renaissance art. After his death his collection was acquired by the Museum. Born in Toulouse in 1803, Jules Soulages practised as a lawyer in Paris and was founding member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Archeologique du Midi de la France. He created an extensive collection of French and Italian Renaissance decorative art from 1825. Soulages died on 13 October 1857, aged 54. The dealer John Webb was despatched to examine and report on the collection, which was purchased between 1859 and 1865 in installments for \u00a311,000 with the assistance of 73 subscribers.",
