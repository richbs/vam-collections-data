This reflected the high cost of tea rather than its popularity, since by mid-century it was being drunk throughout the land by socially ambitious people of limited means.\n\nDesign & Designing\nWhen slip-casting and press-moulding were introduced to Staffordshire around 1740, the new trade of block-maker came into being in order to make the master-blocks from which all subsequent disposable plaster moulds could be made. The sources of their early designs were many and various, and also often mildly eccentric: 17th-century prints of life in China and tea cultivation, bas-relief scenes of the taking of Portobello by Admiral Edward Vernon in 1740, exotic animals such as camels and, as here, a gaunt house of the type built by successful master potters around Burslem in the Staffordshire Potteries. The addition of a serpent spout has done little to harmonise the whole design.",
