He was employed by the royal goldsmiths, Rundell, Bridge and Rundell, between about 1809 and 1815 when he made designs for silver which display a remarkable facility for ornamental invention, often outside the conventions of 'Regency' design.\n\nThis group uses preliminary sketches and a full-scale design by Stothard for a candelabrum to illustrate what can happen when an artist works in a field with conventions with which he is not completely familiar. The designs are shown with the well-known sources in which he found his inspiration.\nHis treatment of them was, however, slightly unorthodox, so that his design had to be modified to make it conform to other 'Regency' silver.</i>\n\n<b>2.8.a Thomas Stothard, R.A.
