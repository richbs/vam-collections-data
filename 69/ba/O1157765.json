The pages are bound together with a thin cord at the top and bottom left hand side, though only the cord at the top still holds. \n\nThere is also a thin brown paper cover on which the title Music and Mirth and the name T.Collett, has been written in ink. The music has been notated in pen and ink and is divided in to numbered, short pieces with annotation to denote their pace and when they should be repeated.\n\nAlthough it is not clear whether this music was used to accompany the original production it is worth noting that a production of this name took place in Hull o the 8th of January 1790, and also at Astley's on 15th July 1795.\n\nThis music comes from a collection of manuscript music relating to the 'Cooper Family', one of whom, Alfred Edward Cooper (1840-1901) worked as a 'Chef d'Orchestre'/Master of Music at the City of London Theatre and playhouses in South East England. Throughout his career Cooper collected and composed 'melos' to provide incidental music for Melodramas. \n\nThis piece, though not composed by Cooper, is likely to have provided incidental music for one of these Melodramas which were popular in the nineteenth century. Such dramas often featured a limited number of 'stock' characters: the hero, the villain, the heroine, an aged parent and a comic man engaged in a sensational plot featuring themes of love and murder. \n\nIn the melodramas produced in Paris, London music supplanted dialogue or, more often, augmented stage language, actors' gestures, and dramatic action, to evoke an emotional response or provide an aural signal of the true nature of a character.",
