            "public_access_description": "This marble relief was made by Edward Lanteri in about 1885-1904. This relief representing an imaginary portrait of Dante's Beatrice was accepted 'contrary to our practice to accept sculpture by modern artists working in England.' However, it was acquired as a piece of modern sculpture of 'peculiar interest to the Museum, with which the artist was so closely connected.'\n\nBeatrice was the inspiration for the poetic masterpiece The Divine Comedy, written in the early 14th century. In Book II of the poem she leads the poet up the mountain of Purgatory, and in Book III she leads him to Paradise. She was in part based on a real woman whom Dante apparently knew and fell in love with in Florence, but she also symbolised divine love and redemption.\n\nLanteri (1848-1917), a sculptor and medallist, was a native of Burgundy, and initially trained under Aim\u00e9 Millet (1819-1891) and M. Lecoque de Boisbaudran, and later at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts under Eug\u00e8ne Guillaume (1822-1905) and Pierre-Jules Cavalier.  \nLanteri settled in England from 1872, and was naturalised in 1901. At the age of 23 he became chief assistant to Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm a position he held until Boehm's death in 1890. In 1874 Lanteri was appointed Master of Modelling at the National Art Training School (now Royal College of Art), and in 1900 became the first Professor of Modelling. During 1905/6 he supervised students working on the figures of Fame, Sculpture and Architecture for the Exhibition Road fa\u00e7ade of the Museum. Lanteri wrote a three volume guide to modelling published in 1902, 1904 and 1911.",
