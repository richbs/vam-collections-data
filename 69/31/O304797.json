It was produced and distributed before the abolition of the French monarchy in September 1792 and the execution of the King in January 1793.  The image on this  five sols medal, which shows the Oath of the Federation in Paris on 14 July 1790 (the first anniversary of the fall of the Bastille), was originally designed in 1790 by Augustin Dupr\u00e9 (1748-1833) for a commemorative oval medallion celebrating the Festival of the Federation.  Dupr\u00e9 was a renowned medalist whose designs captured the essence of the Revolution and who became Engraver General of Currency in 1791.  The reproduction of the design on the five sols medal is of relatively good quality considering its intrinsic value and the quantity manufactured, and is a testament to the effectiveness of Boulton\u2019s production technique.\nRevolutionary symbolism is captured in the images of soldiers swearing to a female representation of the Republic holding the French constitution; a Phrygian or liberty cap appearing on one of the flags; scrolls, lying in disarray, which probably represent the suppression of noble privileges.  However the medal also includes royal emblems and an image of Louis XVI.  After the French Revolution coins continued to bear the king\u2019s head and, possibly, this medal included the royal portrait to reinforce confidence in it as \u2018real\u2019 currency or perhaps it was just recognising the monarchy still existed.  \nThe turmoil of the French Revolution and the loss of state monopoly afforded the Monneron Brothers an opportunity to capitalise on a void in the market by commoditising medal making, albeit using English production.  Therefore, although these medals celebrated the new regime they also subverted it and imported private currency was quickly terminated by the Revolutionary government.",

The Monneron Brothers, a commercial family enterprise in Paris, privately commissioned medals from Matthew Boulton (1728-1809) in denominations of two sols and five sols.  A number of versions of the five sols medal were produced (see also A.18-1997).\nMatthew Boulton was a Birmingham industrialist whose ormolu and metalwork were renowned.  By 1789 he had developed and built his first steam powered press for minting coinage at Soho, Birmingham, transforming output to high quality mass produced coins and medals.  Boulton successfully secured overseas clients including the Monneron brothers who commissioned this and other similar medals.  They were manufactured and exported by Boulton in substantial quantities and were initially well received as being both commemorative and tradable but by September 1792 this type of imported private currency was prohibited by the French National Assembly.\nMany examples survive including several at the British Museum.",
