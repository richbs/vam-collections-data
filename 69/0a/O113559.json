Even though the table top and base are made of a different plastic compound to that of the pedestal, they are all treated in the same way to give the illusion of the piece having been formed in a single process.  In fact the pedestal is formed in two moulds, and the join is expressed by the wavy line around the widest part of the leg, which is the only decoration on the table. Starck intended this to be a relatively low cost table, durable enough to use in public places like cafes, but attractive enough to have at home as well. Many of his subsequent designs for plastic furniture have explored the potential of making one-piece mouldings, a quest that is evident in the design of this table.",
