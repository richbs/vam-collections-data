Article on Claud Lovat Fraser's design for Arthur Wynn as Lockit in the same production [Circ.312-1928].\n\"Perhaps his best known theatrical designs were those for the set and costumes of John Gay's The Beggar's Opera at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, in June 1920, and in the finished design for the earthy character Lockit..... the deft pen delineations of Lockit's features reveal mastery of caricature.  Fraser's designs captured the essence of the characters as well as the basic 'lines' and colours they should wear......\n\nFor all his stage designs Fraser produced clear line working drawings, with samples of materials attached and detailed instructions to the costumiers.  Finished designs, such as this for Lockit, were made after the working drawings.  Fraser supervised the costume making on this production, and insisted that the beggars' dispreputable clothes should first be made perfectly as new, then torn and splashed with dirty paint water to achieve the correct effect.\"",
