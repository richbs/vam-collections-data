Each of the drawings has been roughly cut out round the outline and pasted down, and certain lines have been drawn in by a later hand in places where the drawing has been cut into. A drawing in the Opp\u00e9 Collection (no. 452 in the catalogue quoted above) shows a group of similar musicians, though it is doubtful whether, as the catalogue states, they are part of the same procession. There are two similar drawings of musicians in the British Museum (Payne Knight Collection, pp. 4-79 and pp. 4-80; reproduced in J. Hess, <i>Agostino Tassi</i>, Munich, 1935, pl. 35).",
