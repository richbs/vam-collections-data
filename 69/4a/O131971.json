The strength of the sitter\u2019s character is conveyed in the resolute pose of his placing his right hand under the opening to his coat. This is further emphasised by his steady gaze.\n\nRichard Townsend is represented wearing a contemporary dress of a mid brown cloth. On his head he wears a fashionable periwig.

It is signed and dated 1722 on the left of the painting. This portrait was painted when the sitter was aged forty years and four years before he became High Sheriff for Staffordshire. Little is known of the artist George Alsop. He worked as a portrait painter in England between 1722 and 1730. The date of this painting makes it one of the earliest known works by the artist. The <i>Portrait of the Wolryche Fool</i> by Alsop (Inventory number 90515) is at Dudmaston Hall in Shropshire. This suggests that the artist was working predominantly in the West Midlands.\n\nThe bust length portrait follows the contemporary formula of depicting the sitter against a dark background. Townsend is presented in a stiff pose, turning and looking out over his left shoulder beyond the viewer. The sombre background is also echoed in the clothes worn by Richard Townsend. Both dark palette and stiff pose combine to convey to the viewer the dignified character of Richard Townsend and his position within regional society.\n\nThe sitter is shown wearing a brown coat and matching waistcoat. The style of these clothes is contemporary with the painting. On his head he wears a periwig. Following the restoration King Charles II in 1660, periwigs became fashionable. These wigs were shoulder length or longer, imitating men\u2019s\u2019 hairstyles of the 1620\u2019s. An expensive item, they were almost obligatory for men of social standing. \n\nIn the accompanying portrait Mrs Townsend (V&A inventory number 313-1905) is shown turning and looking over her right shoulder. This suggests that the paintings were intended to be hung as pendants, with the portrait of Richard Townsend hanging on the right. Mrs. Townsend holds a stem of orange blossom in her hands. This flower may explain why the portraits were commissioned. The Orange tree flowers and produces fruit at the same time. For this reason it was a traditionally carried by brides at weddings as a symbol of abundance. This tradition can be traced back to ancient China and was brought over to Europe in the middle ages when the first Crusaders returned from the East. Considering that this work was painted as a pendant to the portrait of Richard Townsend and that the sitter is shown holding a stem of orange blossom it is likely that these works were commissioned to commemorate the wedding of the couple.\n\nThis portrait was given to the museum with Alsop\u2019s portrait of Mrs.Townsend (museum number, 313-1905). Two other early eighteenth-century portraits, attributed to Sir Geoffrey Kneller (1646-1723), museum number 314-1905 and 315-1905 were given to the museum as part of the same gift.",
