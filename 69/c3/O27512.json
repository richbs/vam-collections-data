Wel,, the little mice were teasing the big tom-cat.  So he said: \"Wait till I catch you all.\"  The mice, however, just laughed and squeaked:  \"Just try, we bet you can't.\"\n\nUp to six players can join in this game (one cat and five mice).  First of all you raise the board by adjusting the wooden stand at the back of the box (*this is not necessary in this version as it is already cut and shaped to the base of the box - this also suggests a later date).\nNow each player in turn throws the dice.  The one who has the highest throw receives the large ball (the cat).  Each of the other players choose one of the little coloured balls representing the mice.  You can decide the order in which the mice may move by casting the dice.\nTHE MICE START and advance by as many holes as the dice indicates.  They are ONLY ALLOWED TO GO FORWARD.  If a mouse FALLS THROUGH A BIG HOLE, he has to STARTall over AGAIN FROM THE BEGINNING; should he come to a hole already occupied either by the cat or by another mouse, he has to remain in his former hole.\nTHE CAT may JUMP FORWARD OR BACKWARD moving in one direction only for a throw.  If he should land on a hole occupied by a mouse, THE MOUSE IS CAUGHT and CANNOT PLAY ANYMORE, till the next game.  Should the cat succeed in catching ALL the mice, he has won, even if he did not reach no. 41.\nBut should a MOUSE succeed in SLIPPING THROUGH TO No. 41, then HE HAS WON.  Of course, the other mice continue, to see whether any more can manage to escape from the cat.\n\n7892/30  SPEAR'S GAMES COPYRIGHT GREAT BRITAIN\n\nThere is to the right side of the rules details about BRICKPLAYER, a building kit that provides bricks, mortar and all the components for constructing realistic models.  The mortar does set but can be released by placing the model in water and the bricks dried.\n\nThe label on the box lid is red printed in colours to show cats and mice.\nAlong the bottom edge are:-\nTRADE MARK REGd IN SPEAR'S GAMES GREAT BRITAIN AND CANADA\nMADE IN ENGLAND\nMANUFACTURED AT THE SPEAR WORKS ENFIELD, ENGLAND\n*Spear's Games is within a black rectangular ring which has rounded ends.",
