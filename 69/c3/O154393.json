This brief account is a gross simplification of all the time, skill and effort that were actually expended. The blade was hammered appropriately and a lifting edge rendered.",

Its striking originality is matched only by the richness of the metaphor. Gilbert\u2019s server leaps across cultural boundaries and historical precedents. So much for the tendency of some art critics to classify works according to a current genre or to tie new works to a pattern of historic influence that excludes the independence of creativity as well as the universality and permanence of human conceptions of pleasing or good form.",
