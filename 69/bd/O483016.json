Shaped cotton cut-outs applied to the red ground are liberally sprinkled with sequins and outlined with rows of differently coloured rickrack braid.  There are hanging decorations in the form of streamers, silk fringes, strings of plastic pearls ending in bright pink wool tassels and dangling silver bells.  The skirt presents a beautiful spectacle but, more than that, when worn and in motion, it would emit rustling and ringing sounds to add to the overall pleasurable effect.  Very bright, bold blocks of colour are the hallmarks of festival clothes like this.  Such clothing provides a sharp contrast to the workaday garments worn by the Hoklo people, originally boat dwellers of South China who made their living by fishing.  This skirt is part of a bridal costume.  The type of jacket that went with it can be seen in FE.197:1-1995.  To save time, money and material - all-important considerations for these people - the skirt is only decorated in those areas that will show beneath the long jacket.  Women who attend the bride also wear a fancy collar and apron similarly decorated.  They perform a dragon boat dance in imitation of the groom's original journey by boat to fetch his bride.",
