Delano's family visited in 2010, they could not link this dress to any known weddings in their family, having no records of any re-marriages having taken place at the time of the dress's having been made, although they remembered that the donor's memory had remained very sharp and accurate into her old age and thought that if she had said it was a second-wedding dress, she would have been correct. It may have belonged to an unknown friend of the donor, meaning that its provenance and history are now impossible to trace.",
