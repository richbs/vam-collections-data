The lips are painted in a soft red pigment while the teeth are painted black to indicate a high-ranking woman. The pattern of the hair (painted in black ink) is consistent for the role of Magojiro, no other female mask having the configuration of two strands of hair becoming four at the temples. The pupils of the eyes of Magojiro are usually angular rather than the rounded type found on this mask. What is missing are the faint upper painted eyebrows indicating a noble woman. There is little evidence of these having been painted other than a very slight discolouration at the temples. \n\nThe mask of Magojiro is used in plays such as Genji Kuyo, Hanjo and Yuya. The mask takes its name from the creator of the original mask, Kongo Magojiro, who allegedly modelled the features on those of his wife, who had died young.",
