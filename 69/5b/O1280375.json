The wig foundation, made nowadays of nylon net, is stretched onto the block and attached with metal pins known as 'points'. The base remains on the block while the wigmaker threads or 'knots' each hair individually into the base, gradually creating the full wig. The weight of the block is important for stability and ease while the wig is created and dressed. This block is one of a group of four presented to the museum by Wig Creations and its style indicates it is not as old as the other three which may have been acquired by Stanley Hall, the founder of Wig Creations, from a sale of the effects of the Victorian wigmakers Gustave's, although the precise provenance is unknown.",
