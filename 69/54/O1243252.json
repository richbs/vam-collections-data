            "public_access_description": "Portfolio of 13 colour prints showing costumes for the ballet Our Army and Navy created for the Alhambra Theatre, London, by the theatrical costumier Charles Alias from designs by Lucien Besche. Printed by Alf Cooke, Leeds, 1889. \n\nOur Army and Navy opened on 1 April 1889 at the Alhambra Theatre, Leicester Square. In essence it was a revised version of the ballet Le Bivouac, created in 1885 in response to the war in the Sudan and the death of General Gordon in Khartoum. The ballet was a patriotic work set in the Portsmouth docks and consisted largely of processions in formation.\n\nThe 'Dances and Evolutions' were arranged by Eugenio Casati to music selected, arranged and composed by Georges Jacobi. The costumes were made by Alias from designs by Lucien Besche, with accoutrements by Robert Bennett . The scenery representing Portsmouth harbour was by T.E. Ryan.\n\nSix of the costumes in the portfolio represent a nationality incorporating national insignia and/or flags in sashes with a background showing a \u2018typical\u2019 national scene,  and seven represent military uniforms worn by members of the British armed forces; the army and navy. The costumes were created for women performing \u2018en travestie\u2019 and emphasis the feminine body. This was a ballet without a ballerina (principal dancer), the two dancers who attracted most attention were Minnie Thurgate and Miss Phillips as the Midshipmen.'\n\nThe ballet fell into three parts: The Assembly of the British servicemen; the Reception of Nations,  and the March Past of the British with military exercises and sham fights, ending with Rule Britannia. The Royal Horse Guards were the eighth group of dancers to appear in the Assembly. \n\nThe Penny Illustrated Paper, 6 April 1889, noted that  \u2018Our Army and Navy\u2026is a banquet of rich and dazzling colours; and the dextrous evolutions and dances of the scarlet-coated Grenadier Guards, kilted Black Watch, Bluejackets, and what not evoke storms of patriotic enthusiasm. ...this splendid spectacular ballet is bound to run all through the summer, and win the admiration especially of the hundred thousand or so Americans who are to pass through London en route to the Paris Exhibition.\u2019 (p.222)",
