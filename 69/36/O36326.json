When the toy is closed the figures form three ranks; two figures in the outer ranks and three in the middle one. Each figure has been partly painted with a light brown; yellow; white; and blue-black colours to indicate a uniform; while the facial features are shown with pink cheek dots; black eyes and a red mouth. Three of the figures have moustaches. All the figures and two ends of the slats have been varnished. The figures are all different and slightly different heights. \nA N Varganov is a well known and internationally known maker of these toys. His work is represented in other museums in the USA; Australia; Japan and Germany. He comes from a traditional craft family making these types of toys; both wooden and papier mach\u00e9; from before 1900.",
