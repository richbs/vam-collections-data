The commode is veneered in tulipwood, kingwood and purplewood on a carcase of oak and pine, the marquetry consisting of framing scrolls in purplewood against the tulipwood ground and flowers on the top in <i>bois de bout</i> or end-grain marquetry in kingwood. The feet, edges of the legs and lower carcase, and the upper corners of the commode are set with mounts, almost certainly of lacquered brass.  The upper drawer was originally set with a writing slide, which could cover the drawer and convert it into a writing surface when pulled out.  This was removed, probably, in the mid-19th century.  The front of thedrawer is set with a compartment for an inkwell.",

The top drawer was fitted for writing and small valuables could also be locked away. It is veneered with a type of marquetry, in contrasting woods, that was also newly fashionable.  The tulipwood ground would originally have been a bright pinky brown, contrasting with the darker purplewood bands. Although greatly favoured, both woods lost their original colour quickly through oxidisation.  Several cabinet-makers\u2019 workshops used this technique, including those of Bernard van Risamburgh II (working 1730-1767), who supplied goods to the marchand-mercier (dealer in luxury goods), Thomas-Joachim H\u00e9bert (1687-1773).  This commode is probably not by van Risamburgh but by one of those workshops who imitated his technique. On the top, a marquetry panel of flowers is composed of bois de bout (end-grain) marquetry, in kingwood.  This technique uses pieces cut across the grain, to exploit the visual effect of the growth rings.",
