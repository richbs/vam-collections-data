From 1640 he became an increasingly popular portrait artist and worked for Charles I (in the 1640s), for the Stadhouder Leopold Wilhelm, for Don John of Austria and, especially, for Prince Frederick Henry of Orange. He was Dean of the Guild of St Luke in Antwerp in 1665-66 and 1680-81, and was nicknamed the 'small Van Dyck'. \n\nAscribed to Gonzales COQUES \n70\nCHARLES I AND HENRIETTA MARIA, \nWITH A LAUREL WREATH \n<i>Oak panel </i> \n18 X 31 (45.5 X 78.5) \nTownshend Bequest \n1342-1869 \n\nThis is a reduced copy of Van Dyck's double portrait of 1632, which in turn was derived from a composition of Daniel Mytens (Millar, 1962, figs. 3 and 6). The Van Dyck original has usually been considered to be the version belonging to the Duke of Grafton (80 X 100 cm.; G. Gl\u00fcck, <i>Van Dyck,</i>K d. K, 1931, p. 374, repr., 559; exh. <i>Kings and Queens,</i>R. A., 1953, no. 133), but Oliver Millar has recently suggested that it is more likely to be the version in the Archiepiscopal Gallery at Kremsier in Czechoslovakia (113.5 X 163 cm; Millar, 1962, p. 329, fig. 7). \nThe Van Dyck portrait was engraved by Robert van Voerst in 1634. \nJohn Hoskins' miniature of Henrietta Maria in the Rijksmuseum, no. 2842, dated 1632, is based on the Van Dyck double portrait and there is also a Hoskins miniature of the whole composition in the Duke of Northumberland's collection at Alnwick (J. J. Foster in <i>Connoisseur,</i>lxxiii 1925, p. 215 f., repr.). There is a full size copy at Knole. \nWhen Waagen saw 1342-1869 in the Rev. C. H. Townshend's drawingroom c. 1854-56 he wrote that 'the colouring is clear, the execution soft and delicate.' It was he who attributed it to Coques. This is a plausible attribution, but, from the nature of the work as a copy, not one that is susceptible of proof. It is certainly a 17th century work of good quality. \n\n<i>Condition.</i>Panel split horizontally. \n<i>Prov.</i>The Rev. C. H. Townshend, before 1856; bequeathed to the Museum in 1868. \n<i>Lit.</i>Waagen, <i>Supplement,</i>1857, p. 179. For the composition, see O. Millar, 'Some painters for Charles l' in <i>Burl.

Chauncy Hare Townshend, 1868\n\n'Chauncy Hare Townshend  (1798-1868)  was born into a wealthy family, only son of Henry Hare Townsend of Busbridge Hall, Godalming, Surrey.  Educated at Eton and Trinity Hall, Cambridge (BA 1821).  Succeeded to the family estates 1827, when he added 'h' to the Townsend name.  He had taken holy orders, but while he always referred to himself as 'Rev.' on the title pages of his books, he never practised his vocation... . Very much a dilettante in the eighteenth-century sense, he moved in the highest social and literary circles; a great friend of Charles Dickens (he was the dedicatee of <u>Great Expectations</u>) with whom he shared a fascination of mesmerism...  Bulwer Lytton described his life's 'Beau-deal of happiness' as 'elegant rest, travel, lots of money - and he is always ill and melancholy'.  Of the many watercolours and British and continental oil paintings he bequeathed to the V&A, the majority are landscapes.  He is the first identifiable British collector of early photographs apart from the Prince Consort, particularly landscape photography, and also collected gems and geological specimens.'\n\nRef : Parkinson, Ronald, <u>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</U>.
