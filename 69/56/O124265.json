            "physical_description": "CONSTRUCTION: Elements of the construction remain conjectural due to the wood surface being entirely concealed by lacquer. The base is of mitered, mortised and tenoned frame construction, with a floating panel and two transverse braces mortised into the long members. The verticals of the front frame probably mortise and tenon into the base frame and into the top horizontal. The verticals are probably dovetailed into the side panels, which are in turn tongue-and-grooved into the base frame. The rear panel is then tongue-and-grooved into the base frame and joined with finger joints to the side panels, while the top panel is tongue-and-grooved to the front top frame horizontal, the side panels and the bake panel.\nThe drawers run on three horizontal members mortised and tenoned into the side frame. Three vertical members on the top layer, with two verticals below and one vertical below that all have corresponding transverse members tongue-and-grooved to the back panel. Thus there are four drawers on the top layer, then three, then two, then one drawer the full width of the cabinet on the bottom layer.\nThe drawers themselves are constructed with the sides finger-jointed to the front, the back and base then tongue-and-grooved to the sides. The sides are tongue-and-grooved to the base.\nThe front panel is of mitered, mortised and tenoned frame construction with floating panel. There are two vertical transverse braces. The front panel drops in on two inset tenons, and is secured by a vertical bolt through the top front.\nTECHNIQUE: For a full description of the lacquer technique see Low-Beer pp.154-156. The underside of the base and inside of the front panel are lacquered black ( now discoloured to brown), as are the interiors of the drawers. The interior of the cabinet and exteriors of the drawers are lacquered red. The exterior of the cabinet is lacquered with a foundation of yellow lacquer, and the design then engraved in this. The coloured lacquers are then applied, the colours employed being; three shades of red, two shades of green, ochre, yellow, brown and black, Lines are the incised and filled in with black and/or gol lacquer. Lastly, small holes are drilled in the black background of the main panels, simulating a ring-matting background on metalwork.\nDECORATION: The design of the front panel, sides and top is  generally similar. A lobed central panel contains a rising dragon and flying phoenix among clouds and lotuses on a drilled black ground. The dragon is mainly in ochre and red with gold outlines and details in black, and has five claws on each foot. The phoenix is mainly in green, ochre and red with gold outlines. In the four corners are phoenixes, clouds and lotuses on a red ground. Each main panel is edged with a band of cloud motifs in red, outlined in ochre, black and gold against a red ground.\nThe drawer fronts are decorated with a dragon and phoenix among clouds and lotuses on a drilled black ground.\nThe base is decorated with a band of petal panels, below which is a curvilinear pseudo-aspron decorated with clouds in red, ochre and gold.\nMETAL MOUNTS: The sides bear archaistic gilt bronze bail handles, each on two cloud escutcheons. The bottom drawer has a similar arrangement. All the other drawers have twisted ring handles on single cloud escutcheons. The front bears an openwork tab handle of entwined archaistic dragons on a plain escutcheon. The bolt plate on the top panel is decorated with a cold-cut dragon and phoenix on a ring-matted background.\nCONDITION:(26/2/1981) Lacquer worn on all external surfaces, and cracking on most exposed surfaces, most severely on the front panel and on the top, which is cracked and worn to reveal the yellow foundation layer. Some chipping on base, drawer corners and outer edges. Large crack in base of bottom drawer. Cracks in inside of front panel. Some escutcheons loose.\nLITERATURE: Fritz Low-Beer, ''Chinese Lacquer of the Early 15th Century'' ''Bulletin of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities'' No.22, Stockholm 1950, pp.154-156, plates 24-26.\nSoame Jenyns, ''Chinese Art.
