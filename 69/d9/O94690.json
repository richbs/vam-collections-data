In 1913 he established his own workshop in London.  From 1907, alongside running his own workshop, he taught at the Royal College of Art and later at the Central School.  He was the first silversmith to be appointed Principal of the Central School.\n\nThis candlestick, originally one of a set of four, was made by Louis Galvin to the design and under the direct supervision of HG Murphy.  Galvin was an apprentice of Murphy's and he was awarded his freedom in the year that he made these candlesticks.  After Murphy's premature death in 1939, Galvin purchased this set along with the covered mazer bowl (M.31-1985) from his widow.",
