The form of this layette was to last for almost a hundred and fifty years, and the long gown, having been previously associated with rituals such as Christening or Circumcision, became daily wear.  \n\nThe baby was freed from being bound in swaddling bands, but enveloped in more and heavier garments than previously: binder, nappy, pilch or nappy cover, shirt or vest, two caps, bodice, barracoat (flannel wrapper), petticoats, gown, cape or shawl, bib or pinafore, socks and shoes.  Head covers like this one were preferred to caps and bonnets by some parents and carers, especially for outdoor wear, as they covered the neck and shoulders too.",
