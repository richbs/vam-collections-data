Images were generally printed on paper of a standard size. Here three such sheets have been used to create a larger picture. Woodblock prints are sometimes called ukiyo-e, which means 'pictures of the floating world'. This world was that of the pleasure district with its brothels, theatres and teahouses.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThis print depicts the courtesan Takao holding a celebration to display her new bedclothes. Takao is shown in the centre with her guest Sawamura Gennosuke I, one of the most popular actors of his day. On the right a young courtesan and attendant wrap congratulatory money in paper and another actor, Iwai Kiyotaro, drinks sake. Two geisha provide musical entertainment and an attendant brings in stacked boxes of noodles.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe production of Japanese woodblock prints was a group activity orchestrated by a specialist publisher, in this case one of the most famous, Tsutaya Juzaburo. He commissioned the artist, Kitagawa Tsukimaro, to produce a sketch. A detailed drawing based on this sketch was given to a block cutter, who created one block for the black outline of the image and further blocks for each of the colours to be used. These were passed to a printer. Pigments applied to the blocks were printed on to sheets of paper by rubbing from behind with a flat round disc known as a baren. About 200 copies of a design were printed at a time.",
