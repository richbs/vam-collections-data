The artist was part of the 43 Group, an art group which took inspiration from international art movements based in Paris and London as well as Santiniketan. Members of the group included painters George Keyt and Richard Gabriel. The 43 Group artists were able to create a more secular painting tradition than the one supported by the Ceylon Society of Arts. The artist died in 1969.\n\nThe painting depicts the compact silhouette of a seated figure. Its bulk extends on all sides thus touching the enclosing painted border. This painting is one of a large series of paintings (IS 50 to 53-1985) begun in 1982. The sense of continuity is preserved partly by inscribing all works '82' regardless of the actual date of execution. The subject is derived from a number of sources; in part from the saints of the Christian tradition, in part from figures observed in his native village and in part it represents the artist himself.",

The artist was part of the 43 Group, an art group which took inspiration from international art movements based in Paris and London as well as Santiniketan. Members of the group included painters George Keyt and Richard Gabriel. The 43 Group artists were able to create a more secular painting tradition than the one supported by the Ceylon Society of Arts. The artist died in 1969.",
