The majority preferred sentimental themes, especially those that showed pathos.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nIn the second half of the 19th century Queen Victoria (reigned 1837-1901) was the dominant popular image of widowhood after the death of her husband, Prince Albert (1819-1861). Indeed the Victorians created a cult of mourning, and the rules it produced placed restrictions on women in particular. A properly observed widowhood involved a prolonged absence from social events and activities. Rules on dress meant that all colour and ornament should be avoided until a proper (and long) interval had elapsed. In this painting the wedding dress is a symbol of the widow's recent loss. It also represents the youthful pleasures and future happiness that were now denied to her.\n\nPeople\nEdward Killingworth Johnson (1825-1896) was a self-taught painter and specialised in contemporary scenes of everyday life. This work, probably his masterpiece, conveys a genuine pathos and arouses sympathy for the plight of the young widow. This painting was given to the Museum's collection by James Laver (1899-1975), who was the Keeper of the Department of Prints and Drawings and the author of many books, particularly of the history of costume.",
