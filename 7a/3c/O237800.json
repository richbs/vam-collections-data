His photographs of the Civil Rights movement and Vietnam War protests of the 1960s in the United States serve as documentation of the era.  Indeed, as \u2018portraits\u2019 of individuals, they speak to the thousands of Americans who fought for change.  The two photographs that Levy donated to the V&A are poignant images of young people whose lives were affected and who took it upon themselves to demonstrate for their beliefs.  Levy\u2019s photographs speak to decisive moments in the history of the United States and are important records of the time period.",
