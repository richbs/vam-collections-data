Apprenticed to a printer at Hull, moved to London 1805, entered the RA Schools 1807 and studied with Sir Thomas Lawrence. Early works were mainly portraits and nude studies; his first large figure composition was 'The Coral Finder' (1820). Exhibited 138 works at the RA between 1811 and 1850, and 77 at the BI 1811-47. Travelled abroad in 1815/6, 1822, and 1830, principally to Paris and Italy. Elected ARA 1824, RA 1828. A retrospective exhibition was held at the Society of Arts 1849. Died York 13 November 1849. His studio sale was at Christie's 6-10 and 13-14 May 1850. Most admired in his lifetime for his large mythological subjects, but now perhaps more appreciated for his less finished and smaller studies of the nude. \n\nLIT: A Gilchrist <i>Life of William Etty</i> 2 vols, 1855; W Gaunt and F G Roe <i>Etty and the Nude</i> Leigh-on-sea 1943; D Farr <i>William Etty</i> 1958 \n\n<b>Head of a Cardinal</b> \nFA72 Neg L895 \nMillboard inlaid in oak panel, 23.8 x 17.7 cm (9 3/8 x 7 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1844 as 'The Cardinal' and owned by Sheepshanks by 1849. Describing another painting with the same title exhibited at the RA in 1834, Gilchrist (I1, p2) records that it was a title 'wherewith Etty dubbed more than one male study'. Farr notes that Etty produced a long series of head-and-shoulders or half-length studies of men in costume, from 'The [ew's Head' exhibited in 1827; the most ambitious and finished was 'The Warrior Arming' exhibited in 1835. Etty may have employed the same model for several of these; the present work seems to depict the same as 'The Warrior Arming'. Etty's painting also resembles the early studies of heads of Apostles by Van Dyck, particularly the oil sketch now in the Louvre. \n\nThe <i>Art Union</i> critic wrote that it was 'a small and admirable head, but a painful misnomer, unless the artist may intend it to represent a character from Dante's College of Hypocrites. If the red cape were painted out, and other appropriate style of habiliment substituted, the wearer would sufficiently well represent a chief of banditti'. \n\nEXH: RA 1844 (146); Society of Arts 1849 (LII, lent Sheepshanks); <i>British Art Fifty Years Ago</i> White chapel Art Gallery 1905 (69) \n\nLIT: <i>Art Union</i> 1844, p156; <i>G Waagen Treasures of Art in Great Britain</i> 1854; <i>Farr</i> no 4, pp92, 131\"",
