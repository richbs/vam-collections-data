Down the front run two broad vertical bands, and enough of the tunic is preserved to show that these were continued over the shoulders and down the back.  The bands are in red, and are each covered with five large roundels and smaller intervening half-roundels in pairs.  The former contain various designs in colours on a linen ground, as follows: (1) two centaurs holding a basket of fruit between them - a seated woman and a winged boy above; (2) a vine with three boys, one of whom apparently rides on the back of a bird; (3) a lion hunt; (4) two horses and two figures above (in a chariot, or riding on the horses?); (5) three figures and a flying boy; (6-10) these are each divided into four quadrants containing baskets of fruit and floral ornament; in the middle of one of the roundels is a boy, and of another an animal.  The half-roundels contain floral ornament in colours on a linen ground, and are all appproximately alike.  A border down each side of the bands contains a wavy floral stem.  Two narrow and inconspicuous stripes descending a short distance from the neck represent the shoulder-bands of the Graeco-Roman tunics.  The neck is shaped into a curve and edged with an applied border of tapestry having a pattern of small lance-head leaves in linen thread on a red woollen ground.\nThis example is significant as a register of design-motives which must have been near their final disappearance when the tunic was woven.  The craftsman used them merely as a medium for the polychromatic effect which was his chief aim.",
