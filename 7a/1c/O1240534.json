            "public_access_description": "This is a Major Morgan electronic toy from Playskool. It was designed to teach children the basics of playing a musical instrument. The main play area of the toy consists of a membrane that, when pressed in different areas, connects an electrical circuit and produces an electronic sound producing a scale of 16 notes. \n\nMajor Morgan comes with a set of six cards which can be slotted into his body. These have a code to follow along the top section with matching symbols or colours for the main section. If the symbols are pressed in the order presented by the code, they should produce one of the ten tunes on the double sided cards; these include Mary Had a Little Lamb, This Old Man, On Top of Old Smokey, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, London Bridge, Old Macdonald, Row Row Row Your Boat, Yankee Doodle, Pop goes the Weasel and Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush. These nursery rhymes would be recognised by children, and so the concept of rhythm is not represented by the toy, but would be played according to the child's knowledge of the song. One card features the actual letters of the musical notes played and one card is blank for a child to create their own tune. The instruction booklet introduces the concept of musical notation.",
