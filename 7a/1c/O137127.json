The utilitarian lines of the server evoke a futuristic presence, enhanced by the regular piercing of lunettes defined by impressed gold wire and the ribbed hollow handle made of 28 soldered segments. However a primeval essence is conjured through the arching handle, the simple navette shape of the blade and the raised rib which joins the two like a spine. The textured surface (bevelled and hammered) and rich gold that embellish the piece enhance the vitality and natural feel of the piece. The server captures the form of a strange marine organism with discordant overtones of a modern appliance.",
