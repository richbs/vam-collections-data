Twisted warp fringe at either end.\n\nThe central part has a red ground decorated with small isolated floral sprigs of blue flowers with white details and green leaves in offset rows - in one row facing right and in the next row facing left. The corner motifs are on a white ground featuring a vase with a pair of branching floral stems with red and purple exotic flower heads. Between these is an inward pointing stylised cypress tree, the centre of which is red with a single stem with three blossoms in green and blue. Around this is a green border with a single stem with red and purple flower heads and an outer edge of green leaves. At the top of the cypress tree is a semi-circular carnation fan, a floral sprig and a pair of multi-coloured birds, possibly parrots.\n\nThis rectangular panel has a narrow border with a blue ground and an undulating stem bearing purple and red flower heads and berries. This is followed by a wider border on all four sides with a series of undulating stripes forming an ogival pattern in yellow, blue, white and red with a yellow and then blue centre. All are decorated with either a delicate floral meander or floral sprigs.\n\nThis is followed, top and bottom, by a white ground band [1] decorated with a broken meander of inward pointing, left facing botehs in alternating red and blue containing a floral sprig and edged with green leaves. Between the botehs is a pair of flower heads in three variations. This is followed by a 43.5 cm deep band containing four inward pointing and right facing botehs on a white ground which is covered with a small scale pattern of red fan-like motifs. The main motifs of the botehs include a heart-shaped receptacle at the base, a pair of peacocks each holding in its mouth a snake, separated by a shallow tray or dish on the top of which is a small double-headed eagle, with each beak holding an undulating green stem with flower heads and botehs which frame the central boteh and which are alternately red or blue. Over this is a bird holding onto a floral stem which terminates in a large carnation. The predominate colours are dark red, purple, dark blue, green and yellow. In between the four large botehs is a repeating pattern of a small boteh and a single bird at the top and a broken link to a feather like form which contains an elongated boteh in blue or red or purple.\n\nThe whole design is then framed by borders:\n\n[2] yellow ground with a broken green meander formed by small botehs, alternately blue with red centres or red with blue centres;\n\nRepeat of border [1] but on a larger scale;\n\nRepeat of border [2];\n\nFinally with an undecorated red border.\n\nThere are areas where the red dye has taken unevenly. At the end (opposite the Museum Number) there is a section of the outermost red border which remains white.",
