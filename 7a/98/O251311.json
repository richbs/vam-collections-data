            "public_access_description": "Richard Learoyd\u2019s photographs are unique images made with a specifically built camera.  The camera is the size of a small room, in which the artists pins direct colour positive paper (known as dye destruction, Cibachrome or Ilfachrome) to the back wall and views the image, much as inside a camera obscura. An image cast by a lens fixed to the front wall is projected onto the paper and the resulting exposed sheet is fed directly into a print processing machine connected to the  walk-in camera / dark room.  The fact that this process is a direct positive on a large scale, with no  print enlargement from a negative or transparency, results in an image of astounding clarity, detail and lack of film-grain.  The effect is almost hyper real.\n\nUnlike in most conventional photography, objects and people are brought to the immovable camera and placed and arranged in front.  He also works outside the convention of a photographic sequence or series, but in a cohesive grouping of singular images. Learoyd\u2019s seemingly simple or restrained compositional arrangements belie complex conceptual and philosophical ideas, many of which question the nature of optics and the practice of photography itself.  The chosen subject matter however does not overtly attempt to fulfil an externalised cultural or theoretical brief, but carries its message initially through sheer visual impact. \n\nThis image  of a mirror on a plinth (the quintessential still-life prop) hints at the trope of photography itself as a philosophical mirror held up to the real world.  The subject reflects back the method of its recording \u2013 the out-of-focus black rectangle of parts of the camera,  the full size of which is implied by the negative space outside the scope of the reflection.  The pin-sharp focus is trained on the surface and scratches on the surface of the mirror glass.  Learoyd\u2019s unique process, yielding incredible detail and descriptive power, is used as a self-reflexive device.  In this way, the image could be considerd as a kind of self portrait, or at least a portrait of a profession or the process of photography.",
