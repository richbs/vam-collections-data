It has been produced in over 25 countries.\n  \nMaria Bjornson's design shows costumes for dancers and singers in the masquerade - a costume for a half man-half woman, 'fan lady' and 'frilly'.  The final effect of the costumes can be seen from the outrageous and glitzy fabric samples, and the scene captures all the sense of late 19th century Paris, with its luxury and excess.  By the 1980s costume designers had found out the wealth of fabrics from India to be bought in the London district of Southall, and many of Bjornson's gold embroidered materials were sari fabrics. The half man-half woman costume was made by a husband and wife team of costumiers; the husband was responsible for the male tailoring while the wife created the dress.",
