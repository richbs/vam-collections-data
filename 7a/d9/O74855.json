            "public_access_description": "Richard Hilliard, the artist's father, was a leading goldsmith and citizen of Exeter in Devon. He is shown here at the age of 58 in the year 1577. He had taken a prominent role in the defence of the city in 1549 when it was threatened by rioters protesting against King Edward VI's introduction of a new Protestant Prayer Book. Under Edward, England was a safe haven for Protestant refugees from the European Continent. But in the reign that followed (1553-1558) - that of `Bloody Mary' (the ardent Roman Catholic Mary I) \u2013 numerous Protestants left England, and the young Hilliard was sent to Geneva. This miniature, along with Hilliard's own self portrait and that of his wife, Alice (both of which are also in the V&A) are the earliest surviving examples by an artist in England of such intimate portraits of himself and his family.",

Full Citation:\n\n\"NICHOLAS HILLIARD\n\n<b>Richard Hilliard</b> 157(7?)\n\n<i>Victoria & Albert Museum (P.154-1910)</i>\nVellum stuck onto card, the back of which has been obscured by another card stuck to it at a later date, circular, 41 mm, 1 19/32 in. diam.\n\nRichard Hilliard (1518/19-1594), goldsmith of Exeter, was of reformist bent and father of Nicholas.\n\nThe descent of this miniature is identical to that of the self-portrait (no. 49) which, as in the case of the latter, presupposes the miniature was painted in France or that Hilliard was in England for a period during his known time in France, if the date of 1577 is correct.  V. J. Murrell points out that the last figure of the date has completely flaked away and that it could have been erroneously restored.  Auerbach (<i>Hilliard</i>, p. 2) established Richard\u2019s birth to 1518/19 and, as he is fifty-eight in the miniature, this would give us a date of either 1576 or 1577.  If the former it could work as having been painted just before the artist left for France which was by July 1576.\n\nCondition is generally good apart from flaking in the background which has been restored with a paint that has discoloured.  The miniature was once set into a frame along the lines of that still around Alice Brandon (no. 77) which bore an inscription recorded by De Piles: <i>Ricardux Hilliardus quondam vice-comes civitatis et comitatus Exonia, anno 1560, aetatis suae 58, annoq(ue) Domini 1577</i> (<i>Art of Painting</i>, London, 1706, p. 431).  This was discarded (see under Nicholas No. 49) when it was inset into a snuff-box.\n\nAn eighteenth century copy is in the Buccleuch collection (Auerbach, <i>Hilliard</i>, p. 293 (32)).\n\nINSCRIBED: On either side of the head: <i>Aetatis suae 58 / Anno Dni. 157(?)</i> (restored to a 7) On a paper at the back of the frame an inscription by Lady Caroline Liddell: <i>Hilliard the / Father painted by his / son \u2013 See an acct of these / pictures in H. Walpole\u2019s / anec. Of pai(n)ting vol I art / Hilliard / These pictures were in the col / lection of the last and only Earl / of Leicester and were given by / him to the late field / Marshall Sir Robert / Rich / C E Liddell.</i>\n\nCOLLECTIONS: The descent is identical to the one of Nicholas (see no. 49) [This or both this and the one of Richard Hilliard (no. 48) are referred to in the will of Laurence Hilliard dated February 21st 1640 bequeathing to his son, Thomas, \u201cby way of Leagacey my gran Father(s) (pic) Hillyard his picture in an ivrey box with a Cristall vpponst\u201d (Auerbach , <i>Hilliard</i>, p. 227) this originally read \u201cmy Fathars pic\u201d and was altered to \u201cmy gran Fathar\u201d; both are next referred to by de Piles in 1706 when in the possession of Simon Fanshaw: \u201cThere are moreover, two wonderful pieces of his, now in the Possession of <i>Simon Fanshaw</i>, Esq; and by him valu\u2019d, nor without reason, as \u2018tis the opinion of some good Judges, at above 50 Guineas each, tho\u2019 not much bigger than a Crown-Piece.  One of these is the Picture of our Artist himself, with this / inscription in Gold Letters round it. / <i>Nicolaus</i>\u2026 / The other is the Picture of his Father\u2026These two pictures in </i>Miniature</i> are so Masterly done, that not only the Faces are finely colour\u2019d an naturally with a good <i>Rilievo</i>; but that almost each single Hair is express\u2019d.\u201d (De Piles, <i>The Art of Painting</i>, London 1706, pp. 430-31 and Vertue. <i>Notebooks</i>, II, p. 129); both were acquired by John Sidney, 6th Earl of Leicester (1680-1737) and passed on his death to his brother Jocelyn Sidney, 7th and last Earl of Leicester (d. 1743); these facts are recorded by Vertue when he saw them at Leicester House in 1735 and in addition he records: \u201cthe writeing round these two pictures and the gilt mettal Frames first made for them was taken away and the two pictures sett in a gold Snuff box \u2013 by the present Earl of Leicester who had them from his Brother. but I wish them to be returned into their old Frames again\u201d (Vertue, <i>Notebooks</i>, IV, p. 80); Walpole records that the Earl of Leicester gave the snuff box to Field-Marshal Sir Robert Rich, Bt, (<i>Anecdotes of Painting in England</i>, London, 1782, ed, I, p. 257 note); descended from Sir Robert Rich, 4th Bt, (1685-1768) to his son, Lt- General Sir Robt Rich, 5th Bt, (1714-85); they passed from him to a Mrs Clavering who gave them to her niece, Caroline Elizabeth (d. 1890), eldest daughter of George, 5th Viscount Barrington, in 1843 on her marriage to the Hon Thomas Liddell; she, in turn, gave them to her niece, Mary Frances (d. 1913), daughter of William, 6th Viscount Barrington, and wife of Alfred Sartoris; she sold them at Christie\u2019s 27th June 1906 (lot 76); bt, Hodgkins; acquired by George Salting and bequeathed by him with his collection to the V&A, 1910].\n\nLITERATURE: V&A, 1947 (13).
