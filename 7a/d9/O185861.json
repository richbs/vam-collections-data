The poster refers unmistakably to Coca-Cola by imitating the colour, design and logo-style of its brand name and by manipulating the slogan then current, \"Coca-Cola is it\". Action Alliance United Left was an electoral alliance formed in February 1990 between Die Nelken [The Carnations] a small Marxist party founded on 13 January 1990 and Vereinigte [United Left]. Strongly against a capitalist annexation of the German Democratic Republic by the Federal Republic, they sought a renewal of socialism in the context of a market economy with worker participation in decision making and within a socially determined overall plan.\n\nThe Alliance of the United Left (Aktionsb\u00fcndnis Vereinigte Linke/AVL) was formed out of the ruins of the Socialist Unity Party (Socialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands/SED) to contest the elections of March 1990 for the Volkshammer. The election was, in effect, a plebiscite for the reunification of Germany. This design sought to raise the spectre of the Americanization of the country through one of its most powerful symbols of capitalism, Coke. Using the brands characteristic colour scheme and lettering the AVL asked the viewer whether a united Germany would mean the consumption of East Germany by the market. The answer was clear when the conservative Alliance for German effectively won and set about working for reunification, an event that took place in October 1990.",
