            "public_access_description": "Snuff, or powdered tobacco, was widely popular throughout Europe from the 17th century. Sniffed from the back of the hand, from pinched fingers or from a spoon, snuff was enjoyed on social occasions and would be placed on the table or passed around a group. Thousands of small portable boxes to contain the powder, were made as personal accessories, often in novel designs, to be given as gifts.\n\nShoe and boot shaped snuff boxes were made throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Shoes have long been associated with love and marriage and were often given for good luck. This carved wooden snuff box appears to be made in rosewood, one of the most costly and desirable hardwoods. The top of the shoe has been hollowed out to form a container for the snuff covered by a sliding lid. The front of the shoe is decorated with a floral motif, in a combination of staining and brass piqu\u00e9 work. On the sole, metal is inlaid at the toe and heel, perhaps a device to stop the container tipping easily. The size and weight of this snuff box suggests it was intended as table ware rather than as a portable container.",
