Most of its founders were members of the Clapham Sect, a group of activist evangelical Christians. They included Henry Thornton MP and William Wilberforce MP. The founders of the Society were committed to three great enterprises: abolition of the transatlantic slave trade, social reform at home and world evangelisation. \n\nThe Society\u2019s overseas mission work began in Sierra Leone in 1804 but spread rapidly to India, Canada, New Zealand and the area around the Mediterranean. Its main areas of work in Africa have been in Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Congo, Rwanda and Sudan. This leather amulet was purchased from the Church Missionary Society for the V&A\u2019s Circulation department collection in 1966. The amulet was produced by an Islamic community in West Africa, possibly the Hausa of northern Nigeria. The three stitched leather pouches will contain paper handwritten with ayat (verses) from the Qu\u2019ran. The prayers are believed to offer protection to the wearer of the amulet.",
