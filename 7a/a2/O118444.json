It was usually made of rich materials (silks) and adorned with orphrey bands, embroidered with images of particular symbolic significance in Christianity. Different colours were used for different seasons in the Christian calendar, black being appropriate for funerals or requiem masses. This chasuble was recycled from a pall, a cloth used to cover a coffin. The embroidery dates to the early 16th century, while the style of the vestment dates to after 1600. The initials RJ on the back are those of the person for whose coffin the cloth was originally made (Robert Thornton, Abbot of Jervaulx).\n\nThe velvet was probably made in Italy or Spain, then the major velvet-weaving centres in Europe, and provided an ideal foil for rich embroidery which might be executed at home or abroad.",

The recommendation from Keeper Kendrick for the Council for Art at a meeting held on 23 June 1902 stated: 'These 3 chasubles, the property of Mrs Hedley, came from Hexham; they have not been in use for 20 years. The black chasuble appears to have been made from a pall, and the blue and red ones, as is very usual, from copes. They are all of English needlework; early 16th century'. (A. Kendrick's Report, 21/06/1902, RP. 87187/1902)\n\nRobert Thornton, to whom the initials RT refer, was 22nd Abbot of Jervaulx Abbey, Wensleydale, Yorkshire, from 1510 to 1533.  His tombstone is in nearby Middleham Church.\n\nHistorical significance: Black textiles of this period seldom survive intact because of the corrosive effect of the dyestuffs on the fabric. This is interesting as an example of a garment made specifically for a particular clergyman, and for the fact that after the Reformation it was probably cut down into its existing shape and continued in use.",

Probably originally for the pall covering his coffin.The silk velvet was probably made in either Italy or Spain, the main centres of silk production in Europe at this time.\n\nAttribution note: Made for Robert Thornton, Abbot of Jervaulx 1510-1533\nReason For Production: Commission", 
            "historical_context_note": "<i>Vestment</i>. \nThis chasuble is the vestment worn by a Catholic priest when celebrating the Mass. It was - and is - worn over the alb and stole. This style of chasuble became widespread after 1600. Prior to that - at the time from which this embroidery dates - chasubles were circular garments which slipped on over the head.\n\nPrior to the 1960s, the priest stood facing the altar with his back to the congregation, so the back of the chasuble was visible most of the time. This fact usually accounts for the dominant imagery being on the back and the construction being more perfect there. This chasuble is probably made from Italian (or Spanish) velvet, cut down from its original bell shape into the fiddle-shape that became popular in the early seventeenth century. The colour suggests this chasuble would have been worn for requiem masses or for Easter. \n\nThe velvet was probably made in Italy or Spain, then the major velvet weaving centres in Europe, and provided an ideal foil for rich embroidery which might be executed at home or abroad.\n \n<i>Bibliographical references</i> \nJohnstone, Pauline. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>.
