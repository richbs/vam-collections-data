The patterns include ribbon motifs that were characteristic of European work, but the complex, small-scale geometric motifs derive from Islamic designs that originated in the Middle East.  At that time, the Eastern Mediterranean sat firmly in the centre of the known world and its connections with East and South Asia, Europe and Africa, made it a hub of great trade routes.  Its artists and craftsmen produced large quantities of work for export but the trade routes also carried ideas for design that were then taken up by craftsmen all around the Mediterranean.",
