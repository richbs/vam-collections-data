Pugin was reluctant to provide designs because he knew little about the family. He charged \u00a320 for the set of drawings in 1850. It is probably that much of Pugin's detail was altered in execution. Crace supervised the work which took some time to complete. He provided furniture and fittings after Pugin's death.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
