Their purpose was purely decorative.\n\nPeople\nThe form, and some of the ornament, such as the laurel swag and acanthus leaves on the body of this vase, are based on a design by the Italian printmaker Stefano della Bella (1610-1664). He produced about 1,400 prints during his lifetime, which were very influential, particularly a series of designs for vases in Raccolta di Vasi Diversi, published between 1639 and 1648. The design was adapted by the architect Robert Adam (1728-1792), whose drawing, now in Sir John Soane's Museum in London, was copied by the highly-fashionable silversmithing partnership (active from 1758) of John Parker and Edward Wakelin.\n\nVase Mania\nThe vase was arguably the most fashionable interior design accessory of the late 18th century, and a distinctive icon of the Neo-classical style. Inspired by the revival of interest in the antique world, the vase was often based, as here, on engraved design sources of a later period. This silver vase was at the top end of the market for such products, along with the ancient urns imported from Italy and the modern ormolu-mounted (gilded) hardstone vases.",
