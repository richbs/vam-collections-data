They are made up of three outstanding Pagans, Jews and Christians. The Pagans were Hector, Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar; the Jews Joshua,  David,  and Judas Maccabeus; and the Christians, Arthur, Charlemagne and Godefroi de Bouillon. This was a popular decorative theme in grand houses in England and Europe during the 16th century. Either side of the sword-bearing king are the royal coats of arms of Henry VIII (reigned 1509-1547).\n\nTime\nThe carving is highly sophisticated by English standards of the 1540s. It may well be the work of a French craftsman familiar with Italian Renaissance ornament.\n\nPeople\nWinchester House was built by Sir William Paulet, 1st Marquis of Winchester. He was Lord President of the Council in 1546 and member of the Regency Council under Edward VI (reigned 1547-1553).\n\nPlaces\nThis panel is thought to have come from Winchester House, which was built in 1547 on the site of a dissolved Augustinian friary near Moorgate in the City of London.",
