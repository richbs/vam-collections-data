She was the wife of Peter Ist Baron King who was Lord Chancellor from 1725 to 1733. His mother was the sister of John Locke the philosopher.\u201d He believed they were brought from Ockham, the family seat, to Brooklands, where they were found by Dame Ethel Locke King, who had them mounted and taken care of. They appear to have entered the Museum mounted, but as the mounting was modern have been unmounted since.",
