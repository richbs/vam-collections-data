The image, in the form of a greyish deposit on a polished silver surface, can be seen as a positive only if the plate is held so as to reflect a dark ground.  When the Daguerreotype was over-exposed in the camera, as could happen with areas of very white clothing, or in sky areas in exteriors, solarisation could occur, in which the lightest areas became darker.  This accounts for the bluish colour of the shirt front of the sitter in this photograph.  The physical nature of the Daguerreotype image made it prone to damage if touched, and the processed plate was usually sealed in a mount with a matt (or mask) and a cover glass.  The whole was set in a hanging frame or, more often, in a leather or moulded paper covered case.  This example is unusual in that the plate has been cut in an oval to match the mount.  Each Daguerreotype was unique; if more than one copy was needed, extra photographs were taken, or the original had to be copied by re-photographing. \nThe Daguerreotype image is normally laterally reversed, giving a mirror image of the sitter.  Rarely, this was corrected by taking the picture through a prism or via a mirror.  The silver surface is likely to have become tarnished is the sealing has been imperfect, and this may be seen as an iridescent tarnishing usually at the edges of the picture.  It can be seen on this example.\nWhile leading Daguerreotype studios often identified their production by embossing the case with the studio's name and address, or inserting a printed slip beneath the plate, or inscribing the image surface with a signature, most Daguerreotypes are, like this one, anonymous.  Sometimes the name of the sitter was engraved on the cover glass, scratched on the back of the plate or written on a piece of paper pasted to the cover.  However, most subjects of Daguerreotypes are now as anonymous as their makers.  This example carried an inscription: 'Daguerreotype of the late Egerton Cleeve, 5th and youngest son of late Lt. Col. W. Cleeve RA. Born 9 August 1827. Died 1850 at Monte Video of yellow fever unmarried'.  The main function of the process was to record loved ones. ",
