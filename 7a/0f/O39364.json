This was due to the lengthy manufacturing process, the intricacy of the decorative techniques, the expense of the raw materials and the range and scale of compositions which enhanced the prestige of lacquer ware and restricted its use to the wealthy elite and merchant classes. The design on this tray mimics a Chinese landscape painting due to its lack of perspective, centrally positioned hill, disproportionately large trees and small Chinese figures. The replication of Chinese painterly styles became increasingly popular during the Edo period (1615-1868).",
