The Society of Arts was founded in 1753 for the encouragement of Arts, Sciences, Manufactures and Commerce and it initially endeavoured to carry out this policy by awarding prizes for the fine arts and manufactured objects. However, by the early 19th century, it was largely moribund until it was revitalised in the 1840s by Prince Albert, the Prince Consort. It was a prime mover behind the Great Exhibition of 1851. \n\nIn the 1860s the Society attempted to improve standards of design and workmanship by again offering a series of annual prizes for reproductions of historic designs, most of which were selected from the collections of the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria & Albert Museum). Response to this project however was not overwhelming and in the early 1870s it was dropped.",
