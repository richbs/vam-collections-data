It continued in production at intervals and is still available today. It pictures a sequence of lush exotic un-peopled landscapes in which each of the four (then-) known continents - Europe, Asia, Africa and America - is represented by its native plants and characteristic architecture. El Dorado, a mythical region or city of great wealth and opportunity, often thought to be located in South America, had come to stand as a symbol for riches and abundance. To buy such a decoration, which was itself expensive, was an overt display of the owner's wealth. This wallpaper (and similar decorations from other French wallpaper manufacturers, such as Defosse) was a seductive illusory equivalent of the conservatories and winter gardens that were features of the grandest houses at the time.",

It pictured a sequence of lush exotic unpeopled landscapes in which each of the four main continents - Europe, Asia, Africa and America - is represented by its native plants and characteristic architecture. El Dorado, a mythical golden city, had come to stand for riches and abundance. To choose such a decoration, which was itself expensive, was an overt display of the owner's wealth. This wallpaper (and similar decorations from Defoss\u00e9, for example) was a seductive illusory equivalent of the conservatories and winter gardens which were features of the grandest houses at the time.'\n<U>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design & Department of Paintings, Accessions 1938</u>.
