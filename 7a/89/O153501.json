His work is sometimes figurative, as in his watercolour landscapes, and sometimes abstract, as in this print which may have been influenced by the 'Art Brut' movement of the 1950s. It seems possible that Jones may have seen some of the sculpture and graphic work of Eduardo Paolozzi, one of the chief exponents of 'Art Brut' in Britain.\n\nThis print was entered for the Giles Bequest print competition, established by William Giles and Ada Shrimpton, for the encouragement of colour printing. It ran throughout the 1950s and was administered by the Victoria and Albert Museum, which acquired most of the winning entries for the collection.",
