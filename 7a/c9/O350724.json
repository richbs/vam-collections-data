Each square is covered, from the centre outwards, with concentrically arranged coloured strips. The strips are of equal width but vary in length according to their position on the square.\n\nLight and dark strips are arranged to give a strong diagonal dividing line across each square and is continued through several squares so that the concentric arrangement within the individual squares is repeated on a large scale over the coverlet as a whole. The backing squares are of buff, brown, black, blue, green, mauve, grey and white glazed cotton. The strips are of a variety of materials including plain, printed and piqu\u00e9 cottons, tartans, plain and figured satins, and taffetas. The colours range throughout the spectrum but a variety of shades of mauve predominate, together with blues, pinks and white.\n\nEach square measures between 4.5 inches and 4.75 inches and the strips are approximately 0.5 inch wide.",
