Ragga began in the mid-1980s in Jamaican dancehalls before spreading throughout the African diaspora. It marked a stark contrast with Rastafarianism through its flamboyant dress and celebration of individual wealth and success. Ragga outfits frequently use layered textures and colour to make a strong visual impact. \n\n\u201cI made [a suit] for myself and then everyone kept asking about it and I ended up making ten more.
