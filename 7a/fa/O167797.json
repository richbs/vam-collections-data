ISBN 1851770712.\n'Throughout her increasingly prestigious career at Arabia's art department Rut Bryk has concentrated on decorative panels. Her early work was based on folkloric motifs depicted in raised outline and a rich combination of glaze and impressed patterns. Her later work explores, in totally disciplined manner, opposing positive and negative forces and the contrasting effects of light and shade, surface and depth. This panel represents the transition between the two periods: it is still firmly rooted in the rich tapestry-like decoration of Rut Bryk's earlier years yet foreshadows her later interest in geometric raised and impressed patterns. Very similar panels were included in the exhibition 'Finlandia' held at the Museum in 1961. In that exhibition they were assembled as a floor, with, at intervals, standing boxes or 'houses' constructed in individual tiles.'",
