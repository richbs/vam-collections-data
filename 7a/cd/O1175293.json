Croce, which not only astonished the artists and intelligent persions who looked at it at that time, but continues to astonish those who see it now.'\n\nCarlo Marsuppini was the chancellor of the Florentine Republic, and also a humanist. He was known for his letters and poems. Pope Nicholas V instructed him in 1452 to translate Homer's <i>Iliad</i> into Latin, but this project was largely incomplete when Marsuppini died.\n\nThe Museum operated a Department for the Sale of Casts (later the Casts Department), which produced commercial casts on demand, and which may have been responsible for producing this cast. This department produced plaster casts and electrotypes for sale to art schools and members of the public. It is unclear if this cast would have been on display or for sale, as the inscription is also on the full cast of the Marsuppini tomb.",
