Entered RA Schools 1826. Worked as a drawing master in the 1830s. Exhibited 141 works at the RA between 1825 and 1883, 17 at the BI 1832-59, and 20 (including four watercolours) at the SBA 1829-35 and 1870-9. Early works were landscapes and costume pieces, mainly l8thcentury and in the manner of C R Leslie; from the 1840s he specialised in modem genre and social comment, before returning to landscape, particularly around his home in Abinger, Surrey, relieving the pressure of his administrative duties. Elected ARA 1840, RA 1851; Secretary of the Etching Club 1837-42. In 1847 he began his official career in art education as Master at the Government School of Design, becoming Head Master in 1848, Art Superintendent 1852, Inspector General 1857, and Director 1874. He was Inspector of the Queen's Pictures, compiling a catalogue of the Royal Collection, 1857-79. As he wrote in 1856: 'I regret to find that I am so identified with office work that it is almost forgotten that I am a painter' \n(F M Redgrave <u>Richard Redgrave: A Memoir</u>. . . p l 71 ). He published An <u>Elementary Manual of Colour</u>r ... (1853), <u>The Sheepshanks Gallery</u> (1870), and, most famously, with his brother Samuel, <u>A Century of Painters of the English School</u> ... (2 vols, 1866). He was offered a Knighthood in 1869, which he declined; created Companion of the Bath 1880. Died Kensington, London, 14 December 1888. His daughters Frances (who compiled the Memoir of her father) and Evelyn were also exhibiting artists. \n\nLIT: <u>Art  Journal</u> 1850, pp48-9 (referred to below as the 'autobiography'), with engr portrait; <u>Art Journa</u>I1859, p206; <u>Athenaeu</u>m 22 December 1888, pp854-5 (obit); F M Redgrave <u>Richard Redgrav</u>e, CB, RA: <u>A Memoir compiled from his diary</u> 1891 (referred to below as <u>Memoir</u>); F G Stephens in <u>Magazine of Art</u> XV, 1891-2, pp26-9; ed S Casteras and R Parkinson <u>Richard Redgrave</u> 1804-1888 1988, V &A and Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, USA, exhibition catalogue \n\n\n<b>An Old English Homestead </b>\n183-1889 Neg FE741 \nCanvas, 103.5 X 137.1 cm (40\u00be X 54 ins) \nSigned and dated 'Richd Redgrave 1854' in red br \nGiven by Mrs Richard Redgrave 1889 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1854, and, according to the <u>Memoir, </u>painted at Sutton, Surrey, 'near where my father was staying ... It is a good example of his minute treatment of woodland scenery'. \nContemporary critics also noted the artist's truth to nature. The <u> Illustrated London News</u>, which published an engraving after the picture, compared the faithfulness of Redgrave's art to that of Hobbema: 'He renders  truly what is before him; no common merit that he is not attempting to \nimprove on nature'. The<u> Art Journal</u> thought \nThis subject has not been selected for its romantic or picturesque character. As an association of ordinary material, it contains nothing more than what is seen every day, in the country ... This picture to be estimated, must be examined very closely: it contains in the immediate foreground a patch of weeds and herbage, emulating in curious execution the most minute and accurate details of this kind that have ever been accomplished; but at the distance from the eye at which all this is lost, it is felt that the verdure of the picture is somewhat crude \n\nThe <u>Athenaeum</u> believed Redgrave's landscapes \n\nthough minute, delicate, and almost too feminine in touch, are the most successful in this year's Exhibition. No other pictures can approach them in amount of labour ... in infinity of leafiness, variety of depths, air, and multiplicity of local tintings, he is unequalled. We should like to see grander masses of light and shade, and greater firmness in the treatment of the foreground trunks ... The blue sky is beautifully repeated in a modified form by the blue thin mist of the wood. \n\nAn inscription on the back of the canvas, with an elaborate monogram, reads 'Rd Redgrave 1854/Kensington/Painted with Copal'. \n\nEXH: RA 1854 (212); <i>Richard Redgrave</i> 1804-1888 V&A and Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, 1988 (107) \n\nENGR:<u>Illustrated London News</u>19 August 1854, p160; Butterworth & Heath for the <u>Art Journal</u> 1859, p207 \n\nLIT: <u>Athenaeum</u> 13 May 1854, p595; <u>Art Journal</u> 1854, p162;<u> Illustrated London News </u>19 August 1854, p160;<u> Art Journal </u>1859, p207; W Sandbv <u>History of the Royal Academy of Arts II</u> 1862, p293; <u>Memoir </u>1891, p118; G Reynolds <u>Victorian Painting </u>1966, pp152, 158, 175; <u>Casteras and Parkinson </u>pp136-7 (repr\n\n\nRonald Parkinson.\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.

This picture shows him as an accomplished painter of landscapes, and was considered the best landscape in the 1854 Royal Academy exhibition. In the 1850s, with his several responsibilities as art teacher, curator, and administrator, he sought more peaceful refuge during the summer months with his wife and children at their home in the country, in Abinger, Kent.  Nearby, in the adjacent county of Surrey close to where his father was living, he painted this view.  It was much admired by critics for its visual truth: 'he renders truly what is before him, no common merit that he is not attempting to improve on nature'.  Redgrave was able to relate a great deal of minute detail without, as sometimes happened in Pre-Raphaelite works, the painting being overwhelmed by it.",
