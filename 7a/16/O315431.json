A central circular medallion (possibly two birds facing with a tree between them) is surrounded by a diamond border made from floral, vine like, motifs. \n300A-1887: Fragment of samite (red and yellow/cream). Possibly Egyptian, Akhmim or Byzantine, ca. AD700-1000.  At the centre of the piece lines of floral vines cross over each other. There appears to be circular motifs either on all sides of this cross. The piece has small holes.\n\nSamite (twill woven silk) was thought to originate from Persia under Sassanian rule (AD224-651). It was commonly decorated with pairs of animals and birds and set in pearled lotus roundels. It is often found in Western burials, within church possessions and along the Silk Road. Byzantine weaving workshops took on the samite technique to make it an essential weave of the period.  It was a luxury textile of the Middle Ages brought to Europe when the Crusades opened up direct contact with the East. It was forbidden to the middle classes of France under the sumptuary rules c. 1470.",
