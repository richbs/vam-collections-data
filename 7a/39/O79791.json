There are two holes on each vertical side to hold the cord of the necklace.  There is a loop attached to the lower bead in each pair of filigree beads, and to the lower edge of each rectangular bead.  A short pendant, of an open filigree rosette in a ring, hangs from each loop.  The central rectangular bead is slightly wider than the others.",
