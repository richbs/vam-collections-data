He was based in Mirecourt, main centre for making musical instruments in France, outside Paris. Although undated, this instrument is probably a fairly early example of a 'Neapolitan' mandolin, made outside Italy. This version of the instrument was tuned like a violin and played with a quill or plectrum. Those who composed for it included Ludwig Van Beethoven (1770-1827) and Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901).",
