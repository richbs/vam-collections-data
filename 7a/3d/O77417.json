Wedgwood, however, was the first person to manufacture them in stoneware on a commercial scale.  \n\nUse\n  Wedgwood's medallions of 'Modern Subjects' were probably hung on the wall, in wood or brass frames, to display the political and cultural allegiances of the household. Sets of portrait medallions were also kept in cabinets. Wedgwood's letters indicate that his 'Modern Subjects' sold best  when their subjects were most topical.\n\nPeople\nBetween 1764 and 1800 Sir William Hamilton, the subject of this medallion, was ambassador to the court of Naples. Here he took a close interest in the archaeological excavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii and formed a vast collection of Greek and Roman vases. The publication of his collection, starting in 1766,  was a landmark in the development of the Neo-classical style. In 1772 the collection was bought by the British Museum. It  was the most important design source for Wedgwood's vases.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe medallion is made of Jasper, a fine-grained stoneware that Wedgwood developed as a material for manufacturing medallions and gems. It was one of a range of new materials that he introduced to meet changes in taste. The portrait relief was made in a mould taken from a  wax model. The details on the relief were probably sharpened up before firing with wooden or metal tools.\n\n",
