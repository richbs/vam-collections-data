The skewers held the joints in place while the meat was being carved and may also have been used to test if the meat was cooked. Larger skewers dressed  beef or veal joints,  while smaller ones embellished poultry or game such as pheasant or partridge.  Few skewers survive with hallmarks prior to 1745, with the majority dating between the 1750s and the 1850s.\n\nDesign\nThis skewer is typical of one of the two basic forms produced. The blade could be oblong or lozenge-shaped in cross section.  Here it is lozenge-shaped, a style used in the late 18th and early 19th century. The ring enabled the skewer to be easily pulled out of the meat. The design of skewers could be much more elaborate than this example with beaded, reeded or shell decoration. In the 19th century skewers were produced to match the fashionable cutlery patterns.",
