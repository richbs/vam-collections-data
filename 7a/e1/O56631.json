(1727-1788)\nLANDSCAPE WITH COTTAGE AND STREAM  about 1750\nInscribed?\n29.9 x 36.2 cm\nDyce Bequest 1869\nD.676\n\nThis is one of the very few watercolour drawings to have survived from Gainsborough's early period in his native Suffolk.  He made his drawings and watercolours either for publication as engraved prints, or for sale or presentation to patrons and collectors.  This watercolour was almost certainly intended for sale, probably through his London dealer Panton Betew, who stocked Gainsborough's work in the 1750s.  It is highly finished, and retains the original double lines drawn as a framing border around the pictorial image.\n\nAll the elements of a picturesque landscape are here: the tree stumps, the rustic bridge, the thatched cottage, the distant church spire, and the labourer crossing the river with his sack and staff.  The colours are pale, subtle shades of green, yellow and ochre, and the sky a limpid blue. The foliage is rapidly rendered with diagonal loops by both the brush with watercolour and the pencil.  The grasses in the foreground, at the bank of the river, are more vigorously treated, giving even more the effect of a living organism.  It is a wonderful example of Gainsborough's ability to combine the medium of watercolour with the use of pencils of various strengths to create a soft and at the same time carefully detailed image.  The reflection on the river's surface of the bridge, for instance, is rendered with light pencil strokes over the watercolour, achieving the desired shimmering effect.\n\nThe watercolour was purchased, probably in the late eighteenth century, by George Frost, an 'ardent admirer' of Gainsborough according to one obituary of Frost, and a great friend of Constable; Frost wrote to Constable in 1807 that 'You know I am extravantly fond of Gainsborough perhaps foolishly so.

This is one of the very few watercolour drawings to survive from this period. Gainsborough sometimes made his drawings and watercolours for publication as engraved prints. He also made them for sale or to present to patrons and collectors. He must have made this watercolour for sale. It is highly finished and around the picture you can still see the double lines he drew as a framing border.",
