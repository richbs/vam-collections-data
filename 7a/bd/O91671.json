Nuremberg and Augsburg were the main centres of goldsmithing in the 16th and 17th centuries. They attracted craftsmen from all over Europe, partly because of their reputation for tolerance during a period of religious warfare and upheaval. Bang also executed and published designs for silver objects and ornament that were circulated throughout Europe.\n\nUnder the base of this cup is a plate engraved with the heraldic device and initials of an owner. The decoration around the upper part of the cup is etched with acid, a technique that enabled a freer and more spontaneous effect than engraving.",
