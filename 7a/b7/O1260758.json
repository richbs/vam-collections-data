There is picture of a boy building a model and a girl watching over his shoulder, on the left is an image showing how the bricks lock. The box contains 287 parts including, 3 roofs, 4 doors, 8 windows, 38 white lintels, 229 red bricks, a base, 32 page coloured manual, 2 leaflets advertising base plates and half a letter for the Minibuilders club.\n\nMinibrix are interlocking rectangular bricks, similar to Kiddicraft or Lego systems.  The bricks come in a variation of sizes and in red and white.  The red bricks have holes in the top and corresponding studs in the bottom that interlock when pushed together.  The white ones have holes top and bottom and act as lintels.  The roof components are of moulded green sheets which are hinged in the middle.  Windows and doors are printed onto thin sheets of celluloid, which have protruding snubs at the ends to fix in place. The base is made of card and is covered in holes in a grid like fashion to help line up the bricks.",

At the time they were developed there were a number of other construction toys available on the market, but these were the only ones made of rubber.  Who was the first to invent the interlocking block is still in dispute, but there were a few that were developed at the same time, Minibrix, Kiddicraft and of course Lego.  The idea behind the Minibrix is that it was real architecture and helped children (particularly boys) to develop skills in building and problem solving.  They were made on a scale of (1:48) which was compatible with 0 gauge model railways at the time.  The box sets came with a manual that states that the models and diagrams were drawn up by the architect Mr W. A. T. Carter A. R.I. B. A., many of the models were of domestic architecture but there were also some grand version such as Buckingham Palace.   The were also sold on the bases that they were high quality, did not chip or break (or damage furniture), hygienic, washable and everlasting.  Though due to the way they were produced in rubber from mould they were labour intensive to produce and therefore expensive in the shops.  After the war the dull rubber also did not stand out well amongst the brightly coloured plastic version and the failed to compete and production stopped in 1979.  \n\nThis set has come to the museum in very good condition, it was brought for a girl called Pamela either by her parents or relatives.  She did not play with it much but she recalls it being used by a son of family friends when they came to visit.  The boy was boisterous and it was away to keeping him entertained and consequently quiet.\n\nAn interesting fact about Minibrix is that the manual suggests a little bit of water helped the bricks fit tighter, apparently many children would just lick the bricks to stick them together.  I am sure there is a swath of adults out there who can probably remember their distinctive smell and taste.",
