It may have been made to be used as a decorative cover for the surface of a side table. \n\nThe symbols on the roundel indicate that this would have been used on in interiors for an older person, perhaps even in celebration of a birthday. The central figure is that of the God of Longevity, accompanied by a deer (which is also a longevity symbol). Other symbols contributing to the theme of longevity are the peach, and the butterfly which is the symbol of a person who has attained seventy to eighty years of age.\n\nThe previous owner of this piece, Bernard Vuilleumier, collected Chinese textiles such as this one out of an interest in Chinese symbols.",
