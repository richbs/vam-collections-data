Special ornamental hooks were designed for this purpose.\n\nRegistration Marks\nIn 1842 a new system of registration for patents and inventions was introduced.  This gave the holder of the patent for a new design protection for three years.  From 1842 to 1883 a diamond-shaped mark was stamped on all registered wares.  Various letters and numbers stamped within the mark indicated the material from which it was made (metal or ceramic) and the month and year when the design was registered.  A record was kept by the Patent Office showing the design and giving the name and address of the manufacturer who first registered the design.  From 1842 to 1867 the letter indicating the year of manufacture was stamped at the top of the diamond; from 1868 to 1883 the year was stamped to the right.\n\nMaker\nBy referring to a table which gives the letter corresponding to a given year, it is possible to find out the date of manufacture, and by looking at the register for that year, the name and address of the manufacturer. This design was registered in August 1845 by John Hands of Prospect Row, Birmingham, who was a brass founder.  The objects are described in the register as 'metal ornaments to be fixed on the end of window cornices'. After 1883 a registered number was stamped on the item, corresponding to a year sequence.",
