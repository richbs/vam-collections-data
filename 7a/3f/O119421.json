The fine and intricate tracery indicates that this panel was carved in about 1450 in France, the centre of the flamboyant International Gothic style that dominated much of Western Europe at this time. After being removed from its original setting, this panel was eventually acquired by the Central School of Art and Design, which was run by the London County Council,  and would have served as a pattern to be copied by its students.",
