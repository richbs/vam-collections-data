In the early 9th century Iraqi potters began to imitate elegant white bowls imported from China. They used the local yellow clay, which they masked with an opaque white glaze. Soon they began to add new forms and decoration of different types in blue, green and metallic lustre. \n\nOnce Iraqi potters could successfully imitate Chinese whitewares, they began to treat the white surface of their ceramics as a blank canvas. Splashed decoration in copper green and other colours, as seen on this bowl, was inspired by Chinese models.",
