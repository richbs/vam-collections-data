(Men had a range of court dress for specific occasions). Not all Imperial robes will be ornamented with the symbol of the dragon, as this one demonstrates. Even the Emperor's wives and concubines did not necessarily always wear robes decorated with dragons. Women also had sets of clothes made for auspicious celebrations such as weddings or the birthdays of older wearers, and the clothes made for these occasions were worn for future events of importance. However, most formal imperial attire will bear the signature motif of the multi-layered rocks emerging from a sea of many-coloured waters.\n\nThis type of robe is called a <i>jifu</i>, an 'Auspicious' Robe. It functions as a type of semi-formal court robe for a woman.\n\nThe wide cut and roomy sleeves joined to wide sleeve cuffs is a design feature which appeared during the reign of the Daoguang Emperor.\n\nThe combination of a <i>batuan</i> (eight roundels) composition and the <i>lishui</i> border at the hem indicates formal wear and here probably a political or imperial association of the wearer.",
