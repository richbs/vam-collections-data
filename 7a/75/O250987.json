Research has turned up the possible original wearers amongst the brides of the Rectors of Market Bosworth, assuming \"Elizabeth Noble\" was a mis-recollection:\n\nSarah Meares of Daventry (1788-1878), who married Thomas Burnaby (1786-1851) on April 12th 1819. Thomas Burnaby was Rector of Market Bosworth during 1841.\n\nKatharine Sarah Lee (1809-1831), who married Reverend Nathaniel Pomfret Small (1806-1885) between 1828 and 1831. Her memorial stone is in the Church of St Andrew's, Burton Over. Nathaniel Pomfret Small was Rector of Market Bosworth from 1847 to 1885.\n\nEliza James (d. 1847) who married Beaumont Joseph Dixie (1822-1846) in about 1842-43.
