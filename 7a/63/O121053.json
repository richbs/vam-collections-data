He trained initially with his father, travelling with him to Liverpool in 1807 and then to Wales in 1808.  In 1810 he entered the Royal Academy schools where he was taught by John Varley (1778-1842).  Fielding was particularly proficient as a watercolourist - he exhibited at the Society for Painters in Watercolours regularly from 1810 and was elected president in 1831.\n\nAccording to Ronald Parkinson (Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860, Victoria and Albert Museum, 1990) the landscape is by Fielding and the cattle and two drovers are by John Linnell (1792-1882).  Linnell also trained under Varley at the Royal Academy schools so they may have met there.",
