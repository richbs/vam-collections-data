The agate cup and cover were probably carved in the Cambay district of Northern India in the early 19th century. The two chalcedony bosses set with rubies may also have been imported from India or the Near East.\nThe cup was made for William Beckford and was in his collection at both Fonthill Abbey and Bath. Upon his death in 1844, it passed into the Duke of Hamilton's collection, from whence it was acquired by the Museum. The moresque decoration of the mounts is an instance of Beckford's advanced tastes; it was more than a decade later that the Renaissance style began to influence silver design in this country. Angell, however, appears to have made several similar cups, all probably deriving from this one.

The silver-gilt mounts were made in London by the silversmith and jeweller James Aldridge (born 1768), who specialised in mounted hardstone or ceramic pieces.\n\nPeople\nThis cup was probably designed by Gregorio Franchi (1770-1828), the Portuguese companion and agent of the renowned collector William Beckford (1760-1844). Beckford commissioned contemporary craftsmen to make pieces such as this cup, imitating mounted silver of an earlier date. A design book attributed to James Aldridge (the craftsman responsible for the cup), containing numerous sketches for mounted cups, is in the V&A's Department of Prints and Drawings.\n\nOwnership & Significance\nThe cup was designed to complement William Beckford's antiquarian collection of medieval and Renaissance period works and was displayed at his home, Fonthill Abbey. Wiltshire. After his death it passed to his daughter, Susan Euphemia, Duchess of Hamilton. It was bought by the V&A as a genuine Renaissance object at the house contents sale held at Hamilton Palace, Lanarkshire, in 1882 (the Palace was destroyed in the 1920s). The cup was taken off display when it was discovered to have been made in the 19th century. However, in the 1970s it regained significance as an early example of Renaissance Revival style.",
