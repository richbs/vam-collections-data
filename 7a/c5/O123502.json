As the leading French medallist he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts in 1881. He had been profoundly important in transforming the public's perception of medallic art.\n\nChaplain changed public taste by moving away from the established tradition by which medallic portraits and reverse compositions emerged from a completely flat field bounded by a raised circular rim. He incorporated the field into the composition, using it not as a neutral background but as the pictorial space in which the event or portrait sitter was situated.",
