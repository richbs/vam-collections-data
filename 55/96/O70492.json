God the Father (head and hands missing), wearing a gown and a cloak draped over his knees is enthroned in the centre of the panel with the cross bearing the figure of Christ between his knees. Christ, his head inclined to the left is represented with long hair over his shoulders, wearing the torse and loincloth. Two angels kneel at the base of the cross, each with one hand resting on the knee. There is a dowel hole just above the top of the cross which presumably held the Dove representing the third person of the Trinity.\n\nA considerable part of the panel is missing. Both the kneeling angels at the foot of the cross have an arm missing. Christ's feet and their support on the cross are damaged. Well-preserved green paint and the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground. Red paint remains on the angel's wings and on the folds of the robes of God the Father. Traces of gilding remain on Christ's hair. There are traces of green on the torse. There are two lead-plugged holes with latten wires attached in the back of the panel. The bottom has been cut away.",

Christ with his head inclined to the left, is represented with long hair wearing a torse and loin cloth. There is a dowel hole just above the top of the cross which presumably held the Dove representing the third person of the Trinity. \n\nThere are two sorts of alabaster. Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.",
