There is a vase with a spray of naturalistic flowers in the lower part.\nBorder: part of a minor border with a white ground and orange, blue and light blue meandering stems, exists along the right hand side of this fragment.  It starts part of the way up with a right angle and suggests that the borders did not form parallel lines along the sides of a rectangular carpet.   The carept may have been an unusual shape or the borders may have been untypical.",

He can decorate both the lines and the medallions they enclose by drawing different motifs in each compartment. If he is cunning he can make the structure less obvious by using two or three lattices of different size, superimposed slightly off-set, as in this fragment. A minor border with a white ground and orange, blue and light blue meandering stems starts with a right angle part of the way up the right hand side; this suggests that the borders did not form parallel lines along the sides of a rectangular carpet and that this carpet might have been an unusual shape. Note also the blue vase in the lower right hand corner.",
