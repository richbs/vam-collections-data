The pattern is based on Morris' favourite motifs of stylised garden flowers and the wool is dyed in natural colours.\n\nMorris was the artist and designer who was the greatest single influence on the Arts and Crafts movement and the most successful textile designer and manufacturer of his day. He revived the craft of block printing and vegetable dyeing and in his own home he set up looms for tapestry weaving and the hand knotting of carpets. He was highly influenced by historical patterns and was one of the most knowledgeable textile historians of the late 19th century.\n\nMorris & Co. was founded by William Morris in 1875, producing textiles commercially for sale in two London shops. The Wilton Royal Carpet Factory Ltd. was a leading 19th century producer of pile carpets and worked under contract for various companies.",
