Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this netsuke of Raijin, the Thunder God, caught by a Kappa. \n\nIn Japanese mythology Raijin, God of the Wind, is portrayed, as within this netsuke, as a horned demon with humanistic features with a thunder drum. This netsuke is rather unusual in its arrangement as the strong and powerful figure of Raijin has been captured by a long-haired Kappa. Kappa are mythical creatures with large webbed flippers and scaled bodies that supposedly live in Japanese rivers. If disturbed the Kappa, as in this netsuke, become enraged and drag unsuspecting figures under the water.",
