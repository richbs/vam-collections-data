With a concealed hinged lid on two iron butterfly hinges (fixed on hand-made nails) opening on a well, at the front of which is a vertical, wooden,  rectangular channel which presumably contained a lifting L shaped catch to prevent the top right drawer from being opened, until the catch was lifted. The central section with dust-boards with a torus moulding, containing six small drawers of oak (metal-pinned throughout and flat-bottomed), with turned, ebonised wood knob handles (replacements for missing metal, drop handles - whose wear shadow is visible); the top right drawer with a cut-out at the back for a lifting catch mechanism. The underside of the central section has four protruding tenons (much worn) and an added batten to position it on the detachable base. The base with a single drawer which rests on a single oak strip tenoned front and back, with two turned knobs. With the drawer removed and the base detached, secret wells (with added softwood battens) that flank and sit underneath the drawer are visible. The underside of the base formed by two planks joined with a bird's-mouth joint. The back formed by 3 horizontal planks, nailed on. The surface varnished.\n\nRight hand pilaster plinth missing.",

At each side, classical pilasters have been added, with an entablature above and a plinth below, to lend an architectural dignity to what is a relatively simple piece of oak joinery. \n\nThe cabinet is lightweight and not fitted with locks, so at first sight it does not seem a secure place for private papers. It does however possess several ingenious features. The hinged lid lifts to reveal a useful large compartment at the top. The top right drawer can only be opened by means of a secret catch. Another compartment is concealed in the base section, and only accessible with the drawer removed and the cabinet lifted from its detachable base.\n\nWhen this cabinet (along with other objects) was offered to the V&A in 1937, the donor explained that he had used almost all his spare income to build up his collection.",

Most were made to hang on the wall, either by means of as small hanger, or simply by being nailed through the back-boards. The construction of mural cupboards is therefore necessarily light of weight, in order to avoid undue strain, and they are usually flimsily constructed using thin, nailed boards. The methods used are similar to those found on boxes, and many may have been made by box-makers, though some incorporate joined framework. In contrast this example shows good-quality joined construction and it was designed in a classical, architectural style with fluted pilasters and cornice.\n\nBefore the improving of winter feed for livestock in the 1750s, spices formed a vitally important part of the kitchen both as a preservative and so as to counteract the taste of meat of cattle that had been killed and salted at the onset of winter. Spices were stored in cupboards with insides arranged like writing cabinets, with smaller compartments for finer powders and more expensive items. Just as the writing cabinet was the most prestigeous piece of furniture in a drawing room or closet, the spice cabinet, although much smaller, occupied that role in the kitchen, as container of the most important items for the cook.",
