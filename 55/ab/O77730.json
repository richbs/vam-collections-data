The inside is also veneered with kingwood and fitted with one small kingwood drawer. The reinforcing bands and drop handles are of gilt brass.\n\nMaterials & Making\nKingwood, a form of rosewood from Central and South America, was much admired for its natural grain patterns. It was used as decorative veneer, even on something as utilitarian as a strong box.\n\nTime\nA number of finely veneered strong boxes have survived from the 1670s, including one from Ham House, Richmond, Surrey.  The nobility used these portable strong boxes when travelling between their various properties, often in times of uncertainty and political upheaval.",
