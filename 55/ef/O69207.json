The chair is mounted on a stand whose shaped platform has splayed and turned legs and four turned stretchers; it has two upward-projecting stirrup-shaped iron handles fastened one to each of the two sides, so that the handles could be held by a child sitting in the chair and using the exercise function by bouncing up and down.  The weighing mechanism and the springs which enabled the exercise function were originally mounted on a framework within the legs of the stand: two vertical wooden rods attached to the underside of the seat project downward, and are joined by a turned stretcher, to which a third rod (angled from the back of the seat) is also connected.  The two vertical rods pass through another turned stretcher for added stability.\n[Foot rest] Adjustable matching foot rest which slots into the front legs of the chair",
