The fronts are faced with machine-embroidered panels in an oriental style, and are trimmed with three cast metal Japonaiserie buttons.  The dress fastens with a half-belt, with a buckle copied from those of the 18th century.  There is a  draped waistcoat front in cream grosgrain which fastens with concealed buttons.  Collar, cuffs and the front of the separate skirt are made from brown silk in a velvet warp-figured cream stripe.  The skirt is mounted on a brown glazed cotton and is boned and taped to shape.",

(In the aftermath of the French Revolution, the years 1795 to 1799 were a time when the country was run by an executive power - the five 'Directors' - that was in turn overthrown by Napoleon Bonaparte.) The Queen magazine of August 1888 illustrated a very similar 'Directoire' reception dress, and in November of that year commented: 'the petticoat falls in gathers from the waist . . . corresponding with the large revers (and) . . . the large cuffs . . . The sides of the coat hang down plain and straight . . . all the fullness being gathered into a cluster in the centre of the back below the waist.' \n\nThis dress is made of satin. The bodice fronts are faced with machine-embroidered panels and trimmed with Japonaiserie (Japanese-inspired exoticism) buttons of cast-metal. The dress fastens with a half-belt and buckle. The collar, cuffs and front of the separate skirt are made of silk with a velvet warp-figured stripe. The skirt is mounted on glazed cotton and over a boned foundation.",
