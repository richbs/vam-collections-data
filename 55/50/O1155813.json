The decoration is based on the characters created by Bertram Lamb, who lived in Chesterfield, and illustrated by Austen Bowen-Payne. \n\nPip (a dog), Squeak (a penguin) and Wilfred (a baby rabbit) were the stars of a cartoon on the children's pages in the Daily Mirror from 1919 to 1955. Pip, Squeak and Wilfred were hugely popular from the 1920s to 1950s and became household names - so much so that the three main commemorative First World War medals were nicknamed after them.",
