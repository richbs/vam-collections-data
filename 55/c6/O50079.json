Morris saw the need for a comic that did not rely on the grotesque. He preferred different flavours of realism, and above masses of brightly coloured pages. The tone of EAGLE was cheerful, worthy and informative. It has come to be seen very much as the comic you could trust, a creature of the Establishment. The characters were chosen as the sort of people the young readers might easily meet. Violence and sex were notable for their absence. The visual imagination demonstrated throughout was extraordinary and the Annuals published every year until the demise of the comic give a fair reflection of the vigour of British comic illustration after the Second World War. \nMajor illustrators included,\n\u00b7 Hickey.... Edison Brain, the Boy Inventor \n\u00b7 Martin..... Pedro the Pirate \n\u00b7 Nevin...
