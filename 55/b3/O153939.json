Powderflasks are portable containers of wood, horn, metal, leather or ceramic used to hold the priming powder or gunpowder for firearms. They normally terminated in a metal nozzle which also served as a powder measure, closed by a plug or spring cap, and are often highly decorated.\n\nThe present piece is carved in relief on the front with hunting scenes; a lion attacks a man, and dogs attack a bear. In the centre is an unidentified coat of arms, perhaps added later. On the back is a turned rosette. This ivory is in the tradition of the works of Johann Michael Maucher (1645-after 1690), although the carving is somewhat cruder. A similar work is in the St\u00e4dtisches Museum, Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd.",
