They hired the then young photographer and writer Walker Evans to record the objects on display. Most of his sets of 477 prints were destined to tour colleges for black students in the United States, but five were reserved for museums and universities, including the V&A. Evans used a plain background and straighforward lighting to stage each sculpture, resulting in clear and striking records of the artworks.",
