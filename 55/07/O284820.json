This cotton was printed at the most famous of these factories, the one established in 1760 by Christopher-Philippe Oberkampf (1738-1815) at Jouy-en-Josas, a village propitiously situated between Paris and Versailles, the main residences of the French court - and the most desired and likely market for these furnishing textiles. By 1783 the firm was so highly regarded that Louis XV named it a Royal Manufacture. Its reputation lasted well beyond its closure in 1843, \n\nAlthough Jouy is best known for its copper-plate printed cottons, it also produced block-printed textiles throughout its existence. Oberkampf patronised fine artists but also employed in-house designers who made simple patterns and adapted work from engravings or paintings. The basis of this design is an engraving made by Pierre Aveline around 1730 after a painting made by Antoine Watteau in 1708 and entitled The Toper. The original painting had been produced as a decorative panel for the Hotel de Nointel in Paris.",
