It was inspired by doublesided Roman coins, which usually had a portrait of the emperor on one side and Latin inscriptions on both sides. \n\nThe large head of Lorenzo the Magnificent looms over this bloody scene. Conspirators led by the Pazzi family had attacked the two Medici brothers in Florence Cathedral on 26 April 1478. Giuliano (shown on the reverse) was killed, but Lorenzo survived by escaping into the sacristy.",
