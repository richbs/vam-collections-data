When she was young she learnt to draw, sew and embroider, and developed a passion for Art History. Leaving school at 17, Muir chose not to attend art school and later viewed this decision as an advantage to her career.\nShe made clothes that were both radical and classic, breaking the barrier between couture and ready-to-wear. Jean Muir made her name in the 1960s, creating a reputation for exquisitely tailored, timeless, and feminine clothing. Fashion design by Jean Muir, of a long sleeved, knee-length day-dress, illustrates the bohemian style that was predominant during the 1970s in London.\nMuir is admired by the likes of Gaultier, Issey Miyake and Giorgio Armani, and has received countless awards in Europe, the UK, the US and Asia for her work in the fashion world.",
