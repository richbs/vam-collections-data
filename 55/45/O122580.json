The edge of the lid is decorated with beading and its side with encircled gilt gesso stars (or 6 lobed flowers) with carnation scrolls in between. In the centre of the lid is an empty space and a square hole. Presumably it was originally fitted with a knob or pommel to help lift the lid. The box is made up of a pliable strip of wood, wound round a disc-like base and nailed into position.Note that the gilded surface is enhanced with punch work.\n\nLined with green silk over gesso. The underside of the bottom is gilded, with punched decoration of scrolling foliage (similar to textile patterns). There is no evidence that feet were once attached.\n\nNote\nThe lid rim is 2mm thick, the box rim 5mm. The rim looks like poplar or willow. There is an in-fill repair (22cm) around the rim, where silk lining has been removed.",

Similar gilt gesso decoration was used on cassoni or storage chests made in Italy at the same time. The decoration is more in keeping with gothic scrolling and heraldry than with the revived interest in classical myths that was one of the hallmarks of the Renaissance. The wood may have been cheap but the decoration was expensive and the aim no doubt was to enhance the status of the owner.",

It does not seem to have been part of the Jules Soulages Collection.\n\nHistorical significance: This object is an interesting example of fashion accessories in 15th century Italy. Even if the raw materials are cheap, the decoration is expensive, as is fitting for an item used to store a much cherished piece of headgear. A number of these boxes survive in  public collections and this is a good, largely unaltered example that bears a coat of arms of an identifiable family, the Buondimonte.",

Although they are made from less costly woods and assembled in a simple way,  they are lavishly decorated with gilt gesso, much like <i>cassoni</i> of this period. Although they have not been precisely identified in inventories and their function can only be guessed at, it seems most likely they were used for storing expensive hats and head-dresses. A design possibly intended for this sort of item is in the collections of the Graphische Sammlung Albertina in Vienna.",
