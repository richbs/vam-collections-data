Each of the two faces are very similarly embroidered with pulled thread work. With four corner patterns of a diagonal band and square motif, the central panel has a hexagonal shape sub-divided into small lozenge forms each delineated by diagonal bands, all formed by pulled thread work.  Surrounding this central panel is a composite border on all four sides with the main edging in a chevron pattern, in pulled thread work. There may be bands of needleweaving within this design.\nThe open end is turned and hemmed with white silk but then worked in a series of 3 [2 short and 1 long] buttonhole stitches in dark brown silk.\nCotton thread: Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk, 2S; dark brown silk, 2S.",
