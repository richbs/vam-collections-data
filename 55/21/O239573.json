She has also written and lectured extensively on the subject. Patric donated her computer art collection - including this portrait - to the American Friends of the V&A. \n\nMichael Wright is a painter who began to explore digital media in the mid 1980s on an Amiga computer. He exhibited his first digital prints in 1989. The artist has stated that:\n\n\" I'm not computer literate in classic sense of programing. I'm computer literate in the current sense of a user. I use the computer as an artistic tool, similar to a brush, to realize, explore and create imagery that has continued to interest me as an artist throughout my professional career, water, light, relationships, family and the portrait as representing mans struggle for spiritual freedom. I see the digital image as soft and as deconstructed information. I see the output process much like printmaking...\"\n\nPatric Prince, Michael Wright and a number of other artists subsequently collaborated in a multimedia work entitled \"The Portrait Virus\", presented at \"CyberArts 3\" in Pasadena in 1992. Video-captured portraits by Wright were passed electronically from artist to artist, with each of them doing some manipulation of the images.",
