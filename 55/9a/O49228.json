            "public_access_description": "This standing Buddha, of carved, lacquered and gilded teak, is dressed in the royal robes of the subduer of Jambhupati. A story which tells of an ambitious king of that name whom the Buddha humbled and converted by appearing in the unmatchable splendour of a Universal Monarch. This standing Buddha is depicted in the gold insignia of a Burmese King of the Konbaung Dynasty (1752-1885) with its mass of jewelled winged elements, high rising crown and  gold salwe (chain of office). The Buddha's right hand is raised in the vitarka mudra a symbolic gesture indicating argument. His left hand is not in a symbolic mudra but is simply dropped to his side perhaps from the tradition of the Buddha sometimes represented holding his monk's robes.",
