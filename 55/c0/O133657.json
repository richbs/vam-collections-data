            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, pp. 280-81\nThe following is the full text entry.\n\n\"Born Leeds, Yorkshire, 15 April 1808; moved to London about 1830. Trained and worked first as an engraver; according to RE Graves in the DNB, he taught himself to paint in watercolour, aided by practice at the artists' society in Clips tone Street, London. Exhibited eight works at the RA between 1832 and 1870, three at the Br 1839-46, and three at the SBA 1833-7. Subjects mainly the peasantry of Scotland, Ireland, Italy and Spain. Predominantly a painter in watercolour (there are six examples also in the V&A collections); elected Associate of the New Society of Painters in Watercolours 1842, he resigned 1847; elected Member of the Old Watercolour Society 1848. Several illustrations for books, notably Sir Walter Scott's Waverley novels. Friend of Charles Dickens. Several of his works were engraved. Died Cordova, Spain, 31 March 1877. His son, Frank William Warwick Topham, was also an exhibiting painter. \nLIT: \tIllustrated London News 14 April 1877, pp339, 341 (obit, with engr portrait) \n\nSketch for John Forster's 'Life of Oliver Goldsmith' F36 Neg HF964 \nPanel, 19.7 X 16.5 cm (7 \u00be X 6 \u00bd ins) Forster Bequest 1876 \nTopham was a friend of Charles Dickens, and so presumably acquainted with John Forster; given this, the title of the present work from its acquisition, and its provenance, the painting must be associated in some way with Forster's biography of the 18th-century writer Oliver Goldsmith, first published in 1848 (that edition, and several later editions, were also in the Forster Bequest and are now in the National Art Library). \nForster's biography of Goldsmith was described (by G Rousseau in Goldsmith: the Critical Heritage 1974, p325) as 'more than a biography: it attempted a thorough revaluation of Goldsmith's age and contemporaries, and it was also an experiment in literary biography'. Rousseau reprinted the contemporary review by George Lewes from the British Quarterly rather than extracts from Forster's text on the grounds that 'the review ultimately presents the view of the 1840s and, furthermore, shows how a biographer used the life of a dead author as a pretext for writing about his own (the biographer's) age'. \nThe popularity of Forster's biography of Goldsmith is attested by the fact that, after the first four-volume edition in 1848, it was republished several times. The first two-volume edition, also published in 1848, was illustrated; no artists were credited, but the 1855 edition lists them as Clarkson Stanfield, Daniel Maclise, John Leech, Richard Doyle, and Robert James Hamerton. \nThe present work seems to depict an episode in book 1 of Forster's biography (in which he relates Goldsmith's early life up to 1757); as an unsuccessful student, itinerant and poverty-stricken, the young Goldsmith espouses the cause of the poor - particularly beggars of all ages to whom he gave money and even his own clothes. In this part of Forster's biography, Goldsmith is described as 'hidden by some dusky wall, or creeping within darkling shadows of the ill-lighted streets'. Here, Topham seems to be most likely preparing an illustration of that episode which for some reason was not used. For a fuller discussion of the popularity of Goldsmith and his works in the 19th century see the entry on Frith's painting (FA 74, 93. A more highly finished watercolour of the subject was sold by Christie's (Scotland) \n27 October 1989 (signed and dated 1859, 71.1 X 62.2 cm/28 X 24 \u00bd ins). \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
