This characteristic late work depicts allegorical figures of Justice (with a sword) and Prudence (with a mirror) flanking the Medici arms, surmounted by the grand ducal crown, above a blank cartouche. The sheet is squared off, indicating that the design was transferred for use. This composition exploits the contrast between fluid chiaroscuro and bright highlights on the mid-tone of the coloured paper to emphasise plasticity of form. Its purpose has not yet been established, but the design resembles another by Ludovico Cigoli (1559-1613). It may have been made for an architectural stemma on a fa\u00e7ade, or more probably for a trompe l\u2019oeil heraldic tapestry. These were produced in considerable quantity by the Medici tapestry workshop (see Lucia Meoni, Gli arazzi nei musei fiorentini. La collezione medicea, vol.1, Livorno 1998, pp.360-411). The first known owner of this drawing, the Comte d\u2019Oultremont, acquired several albums of drawings in Tuscany including many works by Poccetti. This dramatic image is expressive of the early Baroque, and linked to a great Italian dynasty.",
