It was described there as the 'Trafalgar'. The essential feature of a 'Trafalgar' chair is the continuous, curving line formed by the sides of the back, the seat rail and the chair legs. It incorporates the fashionable outward curving front leg, used on chairs since 1801 and known as 'Grecian'. This feature was derived from an ancient Greek chair style.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThe firm Morgan and Saunders, who had provided furniture for Lord Nelson, renamed their premises 'Trafalgar House'. They may have given the name to this type of chair, as they made many of the type. Naval references on furniture, such as the rope-twist back rail on this chair, had been popular since Nelson's victory in the Battle of the Nile in 1798.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe wood is painted black to simulate ebony. The shallow grooves are painted gold to emphasise the sinuous lines of the chair. In the back is a classical 'anthemion' in gilt brass.  The 'anthemion', Greek for 'flower', was a motif fashionable in the Greek Revival style of the time.",
