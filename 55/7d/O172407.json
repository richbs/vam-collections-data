Another modelled version of the figure exists in the Museum\u2019s collection with slight variations and different glazes, and was probably fired in the Stabler\u2019s own kiln at Hammersmith. This same figure again with slight variations was also produced by Royal Doulton under the title \u2018Madonna of the Square\u2019.",
