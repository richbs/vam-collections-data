FC, p 58, no 16.'\n\nNB: Within this book there is a handwritten comment that it would be \u2018unlikely\u2019that these patterns would have been kept together specifically by William Morris.\n\n'AV' refers to; Vallance, Aymer. <u>The Art of William Morris. A Record</u>. 1897.\n\n'FC' refers to; Clark, Fiona. <u>William Morris Wallpapers and Chintzes</u>. New York. 1973.\nParry, Linda, ed. <u>William Morris</u> London : Philip Wilson in association with the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1996. Published to coincide with an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, 9 May-1 Sept. 1996.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'<b>L.20</b> Wallpaper sample, <i>Bird and Anemone, 143</i> \n\nDesigned by William Morris, first issued 1882 \nPrinted by Jeffrey & Co. for Morris & Co. \nBlock-printed in distemper colours, \n67.7 x 52.2 cm \nV&A (E.530-1919) \nGiven by Morris & Co. \n\nMorris is perhaps referring to this design in his diary for 17 May 1881: \u2018Working on paper hanging tulip and anemone\u2019 (BL Add. MS 45,407B). \n\nAccording to the wallpaper logbook the first set was sent out on 15 June 1882. A printed fabric of the same name and design was registered on 17 June. A comparison of paper and textile reveals differences which are partly due to technique but which also indicate that straight matching was not intended. The wallpaper pattern is larger than that of the fabric; the crispness, solidity and distinctness of the colours in the paper is far removed from the unevenness and slight blurring seen in the cottons, especially those initially printed by the discharge process. The Paper version has the same colour balance as the fabric (i.e. the pattern shows light on a darker ground). Although not always used, this was Morris\u2019s preferred method of dealing with one-colour prints.'",
