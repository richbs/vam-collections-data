            "public_access_description": "Costume for Albrecht in Giselle designed by Alexandre Benois circa 1910\n \nThis costume is reputed to have been worn by the dancer Nijinsky in 1910, though it has not yet been possible to prove this link. It is said to be the jacket that he wore when dismissed from the Mariinsky Theatre, for appearing on-stage during a performance as Albrecht in Giselle wearing tights without the modesty trunks, which were then obligatory for male dancers in the company. If so, it seems likely that jacket would have been considerably shorter and therefore the black cotton waistband and pleated 'skirt' might have been added at a later date.\n\nVaslav (or Vatslav) Nijinsky (1888-1950) was a Russian ballet dancer and choreographer of Polish descent and is reputed to have been one of the most gifted male dancers in history.  He joined the Imperial Ballet in 1900 and in 1909 formed part of the Ballets Russes company that Diaghilev took to Paris. \n \nFollowing his dismissal from the Imperial Ballet in 1911 he became a permanent member of the Ballets Russes Company and danced lead roles in Fokine's new productions Le Spectre de la Rose, and Igor Stravinsky's Petrouchka. He also cheorographed some of the new works being produced by the company amongst them L'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune (1912) and Le Sacre du Printemps (1913). His association with Diaghilev came to an abrupt end when he married Romola de Pulsky on the 1913 tour to South America. When an enraged Diaghilev (who had previously been in a relationship with Nijinsky) discovered this marriage he dismissed Nijinsky from the company. \n \nAlthough Diaghilev did arrange for Nijinsky to appear with the Ballets Russes on their North American tour in 1916, Nijinsky's efforts to establish his own company failed to meet with success. His career ended tragically early as in 1919 he had a nervous breakdown and was subsequently diagnosed with schizophrenia. Nijinsky spent the rest of his life in and out of psychiatric hospitals and asylums and died in a London based clinic in 1950.",
