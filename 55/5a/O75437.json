Many, such as Ozias Humphry, believed that India would provide them not only with a better living than could be had in the crowded market of London, but indeed a fortune. \n\nHumphry resolved to go to India upon hearing that at that time there was no \u2018tolerable miniature painter\u2019there. The East India Company granted him permission to travel and to paint miniatures on the boat over to cover his costs. But Humphry's experience of India proved to be a bitter one, culminating in his suing the crew for lost earnings on his voyage home, only three years later, when his cabin was too small for him to use as a studio. The fact was that the expatriate community certainly wanted their miniatures painted--there was much exchange of letters and miniatures on the mail ships that went back and forth. But the richest patrons, the Indian princes, were remiss in paying for the work. One nawab owed Humphry for seven months work, but since he also owed the East India Company money, the company's claim was put first.\n\nThe work is inscribed on the back of the ivory, probably in the artist's hand,  \"Hyder Beg Khan / the minister of [...] Asoph ul Dowlah / 1786 / Lucknow\" (The current spelling is 'Asaf-Au-Daula').",
