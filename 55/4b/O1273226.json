For the de Basil company the Firebird wore a short tutu.\n\nShadow puppeteer, Lotte Reiniger (1899-1981) created silhouettes of De Basil\u2019s Ballets Russes for illustrations in periodicals and as souvenirs sold through the book dealer Ifan Kyrle Fletcher. The folder this work came in gives the price for The Firebird silhouettes at \u20183gns each\u2019.",
