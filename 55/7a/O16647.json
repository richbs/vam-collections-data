He took a particular interest in eighteenth century 'toiles de Jouy' and created his own block-printed versions.  His example encouraged many other designers to take an interest in traditional crafts.  Dufy also worked under contract to the important silk weaving and printing firm of Bianchini-F\u00e9rier.\n\nThis design is characteristic of Dufy's economy of line and colour and is typical of the earlier less geometric phase of the Art Deco Style.  'Les Arums' was also block-printed on linen.  It was usual to check design proofs by printing them onto paper rather than fabric and Dufy's dining room walls were covered with a paper printed with this design.\n\nIn 1933 Dufy stopped designing textiles and devoted himself to painting.",
