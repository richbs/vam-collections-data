A monstrance displays a circular wafer of bread which has been consecrated by a Catholic priest and which is called the Host. In Catholic churches across Europe the vessels which contain this consecrated wine and bread are usually separate, but in sixteenth-century Spain combining them was a popular alternative. Recycling a chalice as a monstrance base was economical, and it also reinforced the spiritual and symbolic message of the wine and bread. This practice was especially common in Castile, where this example was made by two Flemish goldsmiths resident in Cuenca, Noe Manuel and Jorge de Alcantara. In this case, the chalice and monstrance appear to have been made at the same time.",

Layard lent the piece to the South Kensington Museum in 1873, and in 1882 the Museum purchased it from him for the sum of \u00a3400.\nThe mark 'NOE' over 'M', until recently unidentified, belongs to the Flemish goldsmith Noe Manuel, who worked in Cuenca during the mid- to late-sixteenth century, in partnership with fellow countryman Jorge de Alcantara. Manuel and Alcantara were briefly appointed assay masters for Cuenca in February-March 1581. The evidence of Manuel's first will, drafted in 1579, suggests he mostly produced church plate, although his inventory of items includes 'a porringer' ('una porcelana') and 'mounts for a coconut [cup]' ('una guarnici\u00f3n de un coco').",
