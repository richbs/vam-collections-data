Wealthy women owned many pairs suited to different occasions and carefully chosen to match particular outfits. Strict rules applied to the wearing of gloves. A woman would be considered undressed if she left the house ungloved and it was customary, for instance, to keep gloves on in church, at the theatre and at balls.\n\nThis short white kid leather glove printed in black ink is a typical combination of the period. This grid design accompanied by small images of rural motifs, and scalloping at the cuff became a popular pattern which travelled to both England and the U.S. The figures around the wrist are typical of images by Baroque print maker Jaques Callot which featured on many gloves of this period. Such gloves were widely produced and most likely originate in France. They mark the last of a trend for printed gloves which began in late 18th century. Exquisitely made French gloves such as these flooded the English market after 1825 when the prohibition on foreign luxury goods was lifted.",
