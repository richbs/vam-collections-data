Movement of the train is shown by steam coming from the chimney and from around the underneath of the train. The outside of the box has some tears and wear to the cardboard. There are two small stickers placed on the box, one reads 9508 and the other reads 74/6. These were probably placed on the box by the shopkeeper when it was due to be sold, rather than by the manufacturer.\n[box base] Cardboard box base for Palitoy train set.\n[connector] Thin metal rod curved at ends, used for connecting the locomotive with the carriages.\n[box insert] Bright yellow printed cardboard insert with cut out sections for the two carriages and locomotive.\n[box] Pale yellow printed cardboard box for the track for electric train set.

The company, based in Leicester, manufactured celluloid and plastic fancy goods, including toys. During the late 1930s and the Second World War (1939-1945) toy production continued at the factory alongside production for the war effort. New production techniques were introduced including revolutionary injection moulding in 1941, developed by British Xylonite and becoming the standard method used for all plastic production. \n\nIn 1966 the hugely successful Action Man was introduced. This doll, an adaptation of American company Hasbro's G. I. Joe, eventually outsold its counterpart, and was continuously updated with new styles of appearance, clothing and equipment, not all of which were military (football and Olympic athletes were also produced but never proved quite as popular). \n\nPalitoy was sold in 1967 to the American holding company, General Mills, principally a food producer, but also owner of other international toy brands including Airfix, Chad Valley, Parker Bros. and Hasbro. Palitoy became the centre of UK operations, swallowing up Airfix and Chad Valley, but continuing to manufacture many of their products.\n\nIn 1984, General Mills decided to sell off or close down their English and American toy firms. The factory site of Palitoy was sold to Kenner Parker Tonka, the Airfix constructional kits were sold to a French company, production of Tiny Tears moved to Spain and production of all Action Force figures moved to the Far East. A Palitoy archive was set up at the V&A Museum of Childhood soon after Palitoy ceased trading. The majority of the archive falls into two categories - Airfix and other construction kits and Action Man.\n\nThis electric train set rivalled the train sets being made by Airfix. Eventually Airfix sold out their train set business to Palitoy.",
