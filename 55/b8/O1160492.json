The stage set in the round is based on a record, with the label area central and different floor coverings emanating outwards to demark different rooms. Some areas have doors and windows recessed into the floor. There are several pieces of model furniture on the base including a bed, table and chairs, and a kitchen area. Centrally there is a painted model of an actress as LV. There is also a model lamp post, and a telegraph pole with wires that reach out to the third tier of seating. One of the wires has separated from the telegraph pole and is leaning down from the tiered seating. The arm of the gramophone is still attached to the speaker box, surrounding half of the stage area.",

Set designer Liz Ascroft was inspired by the musical cues running through the play, combined with the fact that the Royal Exchange is a theatre in the round. Ascroft created a vinyl record-style stage setting with separate rooms marked out on the floor by different textiles and wall coverings; the stage revolved during the scene when the character of LV performed a medley of songs in the club, allowing everyone in the round to experience her voice. However, some critics suggested that the single-levelled set meant that parts of the story were difficult to stage, such as the character of Billy climbing the telegraph pole to speak to LV in her attic room. \n\nThe set model\u2019s base is an actual gramophone, with the set placed on the platter and the speaker box below. The arm of the gramophone is on the stage and bends along the edge of the round. This idea was not implemented in the final theatrical staging, presumably because the arm would block the view of those in the stalls.",
