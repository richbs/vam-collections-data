Many of the surviving examples were awarded by the School Board of London and the London County Council.  The School Board of London had introduced its Queen Victoria medal in 1887 as an incentive for full and punctual attendance: such attendance by a pupil was by no means always common.  Few treatments were available for childhood illnesses, and  parents would often keep a child (particularly a girl) home from school to look after younger siblings if the mother was ill, giving birth or doing paid work.  The medal scheme continued during the reigns of Edward VII and George V, but by 1916 it had been halted as a resource saving measure of World War I.",
