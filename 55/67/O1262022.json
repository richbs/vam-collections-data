We arranged to meet the boatman on a jetty at the end of the world.  We stood waiting for him with our luggage.  He arrived in a wooden boat with high ends like a gondola.  He was taciturn and said  we wouldn't be needing our bags.  We put them back in the car and got  into the boat.  He didn't say anything else.  I felt I had my family at risk, it was unnerving.  The sea was very choppy beyond the harbour but suddenly became completely golden and then we saw dolphins so close and whales in the distance.  We disembarked onto rocks and he [the boatman] told us we must walk for forty minutes across the island.  The land that we walked on was what I wanted to tell Lucie [Gledhill] about.  A lattice of black springy roots and branches supporting spongy moss and lichen and procumbent bushes pinned with cranberries and cloudberries.  We walked across a fairy tale that no one had ever walked across before.\n\nImagine a circle of turf cut out from the ground and lifted to expose the roots underneath.\u2019",
