His raised right hand holds a tournament lance and his left hand is clasped around the turned neck of the dragon. It would have been fully painted, but has subsequently been stripped of its colouring with the exception of flesh tone in the face, traces of black colour indicating the pupils, red traces in the mouth, ear, and the wound of the dragon, and green pigments on the base. The head of the lance is missing and the index finger of the right hand is a later replacement. The back of the body has been hollowed out and the reverse of the base is flat.",

St George was a saint from the East, but as the result of the crusades he became popular throughout Europe. Having rescued a princess by slaying a dragon, he personified the ideals of chivalry and was often depicted with the tamed or dead beast beside him.",
