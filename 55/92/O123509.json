It was designed by Marjorie Field for the haute couture firm Field Rhoades which was registered in the London street directories at 77, South Audley Street, London W1 for the years 1948 to 1949. The design is coupled with a type-written description of this dinner dress ensemble, detailing the material out of which it is intended to be made: crepe, which is a light-weight fabric of silk or other fibres characterised by a crinkled surface, for the sheath and slipper-satin for the bolero jacket, size suitability, and price. The design was available only in the original design colour. A vertical pencil line shows the seam down centre front which is slit at mid shin. A smaller pencil sketch to the right shows the bodice of the dress. This design would have been used as a presentation drawing and forms part of an album of 12 designs with accompanying descriptions from which the client could choose what she wanted to have made.",
