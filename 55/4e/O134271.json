As she describes it: 'The competition between London and Paris to host the 2012 Olympic Games borders on the absurd. Old rivalries begin to surface, and many British commentators recall the battle of Waterloo, which further aggravates the French. Chirac makes a derisive remark about English food\u2026 the knives are out.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
