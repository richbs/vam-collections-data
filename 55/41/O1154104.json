The image shows an extravagently ornamented stage set, in which swathes of flowers, intricate carvings, and a series of vasts pillars conjure up the impression of an 'Oriental' Palace. The impression of luxury is heightened by the fountain and moonlit landscape which are visible in the distance. Groups of dancers stand on either side of the stage, turbaned men on the left and seated women on the right. in the centre are a group of 8 female dancers. Three of these dancers are kneeling and all appear to be gathered around a central figure in some distress. All 8 are dressed in full skirted knee length dresses with fitted, sleeveless bodices which contrast with the shawls and long, draped gowns of the women seated at the side of the stage.",
