Crawford, on several occasions Chairman of our Committee. The workmanship of all details is very delicate, even the fine needlework of the tunic being beautifully traced, and the medallion worn on the breast, as in the case of the portrait {q.v.) of this philanthropic Parsee gentleman is a finished likeness of Her late Majesty the Queen. This bust in marble was produced in the studio of the celebrated sculptor Baron Marochetti, and was one of his designs for the statue of Sir Jamsetjee, afterwards erected in Bombay.",
