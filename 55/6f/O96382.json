The marble represents Hadrian's favourite, Antinous in Egyptian dress. Reproductions of this figure were made in many different materials in the early nineteenth century and became particularly popular following Napoleon's Egyptian campaign. \n\nShortly before this object was acquired it was associated by John Pope Hennessy, then Museum Director, with the Regency designer Thomas Hope. However the present statue differs in costume and appearance from the figures designed by Hope for his Egyptian room in Duchess St, and it is unlikely to be directly connected with his work.",
