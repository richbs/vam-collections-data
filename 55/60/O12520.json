The Florentine lily in red on white, the stemma of the Guelph party, on the shield supported by Donatello's lion is repeated on one side of the base, while the shield on the other side, formerly coloured red and white, denoted the union of Florence with Fiesole.  These arms are repeated around the top of the base, together with the arms of the four quarters of Florence (S. Croce, S. Maria Novella, S. Spirito and S. Giovanni) and the arms of the Florentine people.  The coats of arms would originally have been painted in the appropriate colours.",
