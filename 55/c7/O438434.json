Under Yoshimitsu the Zen principles of restraint, understatement, economy of movement and frugality of expression became incorporated into the performance. By the early seventeenth century Noh had become an even more austere and formalised drama reserved almost exclusively for the military elite.\n\nThis Noh mask representing the aged warrior Taira Kagekiyo, who, rather than witness the triumph of his enemies, the Genji clan, gouged out his eyes and went into self-imposed exile in the province of Hyuga. The mask shows Kagekiyo as a lonely, yet dignified old man; the use of horsehair for the moustache and beard adds realism to the face.\n\nIn the Noh play \u2018Kagekiyo\u2019 we see the former warrior as an old blind beggar. His daughter journeys from Kamakura to find him and by chance comes to his desolate hut to ask directions. Ashamed of his wretchedness, he sends her away without revealing himself. A nearby villager brings her back and father and daughter are moved to tears at their reunion. Kagekiyo consents to tell of his exploits in battle but resolves that she must return home. After the narration of his exploits the daughter leaves her father.",

From his studio in Kobe, Suzuki continued a tradition which stretches back over some 600 years creating Noh masks both for performance and exhibition. Suzuki has donated a number of masks since 1987 thereby enhancing the V&A\u2019s collections of masks which began in 1876 when we acquired 12 masks from Samuel Bing. \n\nDuring February and March 2002 in the Toshiba Gallery at the V&A, as part of the Japan 2001 Festiva, Suzuki displayed 12 masks in the exhibition \u2018The Spirit of Transformation: the Noh masks of Suzuki Nohjin\u2019 and subsequently donated six masks (FE.127 to 132-2002). \n\nIt was typical of Suzuki\u2019s friendship with the V&A that even on his death-bed that among his last thoughts he instructed a bequest of No masks \u2013 including a mask of Okina, a type that I had mentioned to Suzuki many years ago that we would dearly love to have in our collection.",
