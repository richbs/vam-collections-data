            "public_access_description": "This lampstand with a shade is part of a Japanese Dolls' Festival (hina matsuri) set. The Dolls' Festival is traditionally celebrated by girls on 3rd March. The focal point of this festival is the display of dolls, model furniture and household accessories. The dolls represent the emperor and empress, with attendants and musicians in ancient court dress. The more elaborate of these sets are arranged on tiered shelves in the home and celebrated with special food of diamond-shaped rice cakes and sake. This set consists of a male and female doll, elaborately clothed, and seated on their own lacquered base covered with traditional tatami straw matting. In addition, there is a pair of screens, which are each placed behind a doll, with a lampstand on either side. It also consists of several incomplete sets of miniature lacquer furniture and daily utensils. If they could afford it, a family would possess a high-quality set of lacquered items, which were passsed down from generation to generation. This accounts for the incomplete nature of this particular grouping. It also suggests that they not only had sentimental value, but were also of artistic merit.",
