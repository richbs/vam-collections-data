            "public_access_description": "The Sunday Christ is a particular form of medieval imagery intended for parish audiences. The Sabbatarian movement promoted Sunday as a sacred day, believing that those who worked on Sunday contributed directly to Christ's suffering. Christ is portrayed as Man of Sorrows, flanked and pierced by workmen's tools. This figure would have been placed to a door or chapel and is the only known English example.\nThe figure was probably originally contained within a wooden tabernacle with shutters. This is a unique English medieval alabaster carving depicting the Sunday Christ.",
