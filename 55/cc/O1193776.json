They lived in Londonderry, Northern Ireland. The children wrote poems which were put into books and presented to their father as Christmas and Easter presents. The daughters lived into their nineties, but Pakenham died in 1944.\n\nThis play was probably written by one of the McCorkell daughters, and then presented to Dudley McCorkell.",
