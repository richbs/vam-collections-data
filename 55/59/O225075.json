            "public_access_description": "The H\u00f6chst porcelain factory was founded in 1746, making it the third in the German Reich following on from Meissen in 1710 and Vienna in 1718.  It was established by a successful merchant Johann Christoph G\u00f6ltz and his son-in-law Felician Clarus with the help of a talented porcelain painter Adam Friedrich von L\u00f6wenfinck.  Von L\u00f6wenfinck  had been trained at Meissen and escaped (we are told on a stolen horse) from the city with difficulty as the workers were closely guarded in order to prevent industrial espionage.   Porcelain was so fashionable and desirable at the time that the Meissen factory was fiercely protective of the secrets of porcelain manufacture which had proved so prestigious and lucrative for its owner, the King of Saxony.  It was only when the chemist Johann Jacob Ringler (another escapee from Meissen) arrived at the factory in 1750 however, that porcelain started to be made at H\u00f6chst.  Prior to that date only faience was produced.\n\nThere are many examples in 18th century paintings of the wealthy partaking of this fashionable beverage.  Often the chocolate pots resemble coffee pots in shape, however it is always made clear that chocolate is being made when the pot has a swizzle stick protruding from its cover.  This was to allow the chocolate tablet to be mixed and frothed up with hot milk or water.  The plain cylindrical outline of this pot has its origins in a Chinese shape copied at the Meissen factory.",
