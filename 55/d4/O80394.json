The house was built between 1722 and 1735, and the State Apartment \u2013 comprising a bedroom, dressing room and drawing room \u2013 was furnished by about 1732. The centrepiece of this suite, all of which was covered in the same rich green silk velvet, is the great State Bed designed by William Kent (Museum no. W.58-2002). Although Kent was responsible for the design of the bed, the accompanying seat furniture seems to have been entirely the work of the chair-maker Thomas Roberts Junior, who supplied other furniture to Walpole around this time. These pieces are carved naturalistically with lions\u2019 masks and legs, and gilded on a ground made gritty with sand.",

In the absence of any documentary links to other chair-makers, he is the most likely candidate for the maker of both this suite and the walnut and part-gilt suite, which were probably made around the same time and in the same workshop, as they both incorporate an identical striped twill base cloth (collated between W.2-2002 and W.27-2002). The present suite was seemingly nearing completion in 1731, while the burr-walnut suite, stylistically earlier, could well have been made in the late 1720s -- perhaps in a deliberately old-fashioned style to to suit the pre-existing embroidered bed.",
