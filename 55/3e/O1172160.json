Fan merchandise can advertise a concert the wearer has been to or show the wearer's allegiance to a specific musical subculture or youth movement.\n\nThe image of David Bowie on this buckle was taken from the 1974 album, David Live. His first official live album, it was recorded on tour in America in support of the album Diamond Dogs. This was an interesting time for Bowie as it was a transitional period from the glam rock of Ziggy Stardust... to the plastic soul of his Young Americans album. The image on this belt shows Bowie's hair grown in length and he  wears a more soulful suit jacket than in his glam days; yet over his shoulder is a mask, possibly worn by a performer, featuring an Aladdin Sane flash over the right side of his face. He was still performing songs mostly of this era on this tour, but began rearranging them to give them a more soul and funk feel.",
