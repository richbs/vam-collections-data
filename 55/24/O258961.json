The scenes are reserved in white with the exception of brick-like markings in red on the front of the inn. There is a selvedge towards one side of this hanging, where the scenes are skillfully joined.\n\nIn one scene, two peasants play cards at a table where a third man also sits, drinking. A cat is crouching in front of the trestle table. Behind them is an inn with doves perched on the roof and the sign of a six pointed star (of superimposed triangles) on a pole sticking out of the gable. In the other scene, youths and maidens, linked by holding handkerchiefs, are dancing in a ring around a tree, which supports a latticed platform, on which are two musicians and a cock. The scenes are linked by cloud shaped islands with decorative fillings which give the impression of scrolling plants without appearing naturalistic. The bark of the tree is rendered in decorative lozenges.",
