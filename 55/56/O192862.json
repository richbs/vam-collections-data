The title refers to the computer program that generated these images, which was called 'DRAchenKUrven, \u00fcberLAgert', meaning 'Dragon curves, superimposed'.  The program was written by computer scientist Peter Henne in collaboration with Franke.  Dragon curves are a type of mathematical fractal, whose formula Franke used to structure his graphics.\n\nThese offset lithographs were made from a series of plotter drawings.  A pen plotter is a mechanical device that holds a pen or brush and is linked to a computer that controls its movements.  This machine was one of the few output devices available for computers in the early 1970s.\n\nHerbert W. Franke is a pioneering figure in the history of computer art.  In 1971, he produced one of the first accounts of computer art entitled 'Computer graphics - Computer art'.  In 1979, he co-founded the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, Austria, an annual event that combines art and technology.  Franke is also well known as a successful author of science fiction novels.",
