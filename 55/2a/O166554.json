The lower half is undecorated but above is a woven band of geometric motifs in red and blue and above this band are 4 shoots of red weft and then 6 of white before the pile begins.  A fringe of 25.5 cms is made of 4 looped warp threads Z-twisted.   Upper: 5 cms plain weave with white woollen weft, with a narrow band of red woollen weft in the lower part.  At the upper edge there is a very thick weft cable around which the warp threads are knotted to form a fringe, max. 28 cms. long.  12 warp threads retied into a single knot and twisted together.\n\nDESIGN: Field: dark red ground, 10 bands of 4 inner and outer quartered guls, the quartering extending to form a dark blue grid throughout the field.  There are 9 and 2 half bands of 3 and 2 half secondary guls with star-shaped centres, the guls linked vertically by two red, white and blue small diamonds.\n\nMain border: Dark red ground with red hooked crosses within alternating white and dark blue octagons flaring outwards in the reverse colour.  Down the sides these rectangles are divided by the same range of geometric bands down both borders.  The rectangles in the lower and upper borders are divided by identical diamond patterned stripes.\n\nInner and outer borders: dark red ground forming reciprocal pairs of horns with those in dark red, red, dark blue and white, all interspersed with tiny white florets with red centres.\n\nUpper and lower end panels: dark red ground with a band of eight double, vertically-linked lozenges with serrated parallel sides in dark blue or white enclosing a red diamond.  The double lozenges are divided by a narrow row of ten (12 in the upper panel) white florets divided in two by a pair of dark red horns.\n\nDate catalogued: 2.4.96",
