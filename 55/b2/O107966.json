Instead they were attached to a tape and tied around the waist as separate garments. Worn under the hoops and petticoats, they were accessed through openings in the gown and petticoat seams.\nThis is an example of a single pocket made of linen, embroidered with silk and bearing its original linen tie. Its small size and the short length of the opening and the tie suggest that it was made for a young girl. Yellow silk thread on white linen was a popular combination in British embroideries of the early 18th century, influenced by imported Indian embroideries. The use of backstitch can also be attributed to Indian needlework, although the pattern of the flowers reflects embroidery designs found on British accessories, such as aprons and gloves.\nThis pocket forms part of the Hannah Downes collection of needlework, executed by four generations of women between the late 17th and 19th centuries in Britain. The family tree identifies Hannah Haines, youngest daughter of Hannah Downes, as the maker of this pocket between 1718\u20131720.",

The small size of this pocket and the short length of its opening suggest that it was made for a young girl.",
