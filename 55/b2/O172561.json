He is best known for these later works, but earlier works, like this drypoint made in 1940, suggest he was energetically experimenting with form and a technique of 'drawing' of a more spontaneous nature, which relates to the surrealist technique of automatic writing. At this time Albers was teaching at Black Mountain College in Carolina, but also making trips to Mexico, which he found very inspiring.",
