On the other side is a bouquet of flowers. There is an outer border of trailing flowers and leaves, and it is flat quilted overall.\n\nThe inside has one pocket with a similar painted panel, but the cupid is replaced by lilies and palm fronds. This pocket has red silk gussets allowing it to fall half open. The other pocket does not have gussets, so stays flat with top opening; it has an internal divider. The inside is lined with cream silk twill.\n\nThere is a gilt metal lock with tooled and pierced decoration, backed with green foil. A steel key with it is probably not original.",
