There is a knotted tassel in the lower right hand corner.\nEND FINISH: Lower: 1\" (2.5cms) plainweave with dark brown weft containing one band of white flowerheads.\nUpper: 3 bands: a) plainweave with dark brown weft with a central band of white and red diamonds in a weft float technique, b) plainweave with a narrow band of dark red and then dark brown weft followed by 12 blocks in various colours with slits between, followed by a band of blue and then dark red weft, c) as a).   These are followed by brown and then white weft, turned and stitched in place.\nDESIGN: Face: Field: dark blue ground with blue diamond lattice enclosing 4 bands of 3 rosettes and 3 and two half bands of 2 rosettes, most predominantly red with a near-centre white one.   All are lozenge-like and most have a line of small dark red squares with dark blue centres on all four sides.   The half diamonds down both sides are filled with more of these squares and pairs of comb-like motifs.\nMain Border: light red ground with angular, stylized floral meander of pairs of botehs on dark red/dark blue with a blue leaf.\nInner and Outer Borders: reciprocal trefoils in dark red and brown, outlined in blue except for the lower and upper inner border where brown becomes blue with a red centre; in the lower, outer border each trefoil has a white centre.\nBack: from the bottom: a band of brown weft, then a deep band in light brown and a final band in brown with occasional shoots and one narrow band in dark brown.   The end is cut.\n Date catalogued: 10.12.96",
