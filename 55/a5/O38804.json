Inside is a scene of the laughing dog, and the runaway dish and spoon from the same rhyme, with a vignette of a frog watching, and between is a verse based on the rhyme:\nHi DIDDLE DIDDLE now you are TWO\nand your BIRTHDAY has just begun,\nNo wonder the cow jumps over the moon\nAnd the little dog laughs at the fun.\nThe spoon and the dish bring a very glad wish,\nFor frolic and fun all the day,\nAnd they hope you'll have many more BIRTHDAYS like this,\nBefore they start running away.\n\nThere is an additional couplet which reads:\nOverleaf, you will see\nA Picture you can paint for me.\nand the back of the card carries a line drawing of the illustration on the front, with the words\nHere's a picture, bright and gay\nThat can be painted any day.",
