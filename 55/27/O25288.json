The two children were given medals for their \"daring and clever performances on the trapeze\" . They performed all over the country from 1889 - 1895 under the title of the \"Two Fitzroys\" or the \"Flying Fitzroys\". The family name was Munday but Fitzroy, Fred's middle name became his professional name.  His sister used the name Miss Adeline Patty. Her family name was Adeline Martha Munday. After 1895 the youngest sister joined the family act.\n\nThe V&A was given a small collection of medals awarded to Fred Fitzroy and a photograph of him aged about 12 is in the Theatre Museum. The medal itself was mass produced by a manufacturer in Birmingham. Fred and his sister received a number of medals in gold and silver in recognition of outstanding performances. By November 1891 it was reported that they had been given twelve gold and silver medals each and two watches.",
