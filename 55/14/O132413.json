Worked from the age of seven in a lace factory in Nottingham, but painted in his spare time, mainly portraits; seeing prints by John Martin inspired him to paint landscape. Began as a professional painter 1835, visited London 1836, and received his only formal training there 1838 - twelve lessons from the landscape painter and watercolourist James Baker Pyne. Exhibited 28 landscapes at the RA between 1838 and 1874; he always complained, with some reason it seems, that his work was badly hung. Also exhibited 33 works at the BI 1841-67 and six at the SBA 1851-78 (elected Member 1875). Moved to Liverpool 1844, exhibiting at the Liverpool Academy 1845-51 (elected Member 1847). Entered (unsuccessfully) 1847 competition for decoration of new Palace of Westminster, with 'Charles I Raising his Standard ... ' (now Nottingham Castle Museum and Art Gallery); achieved great success with one of his large views of London, 'The New Houses of Parliament, Westminster', at the BI 1858. Later works achieved high prices, his popularity culminating in the exhibition of 57 paintings to mark the opening of the Nottingham Castle Museum and Art Gallery 1878. Lived in Croydon, Surrey, 1850-3, and Thorpe Green, near Chertsey, Surrey, until 1861; finally settled in Chiswick, Middlesex, where he died 13 December 1878; his studio sale was at Christie's 23-5 March 1882. His two sons, Alfred (1844-93) and Henry Thomas (c1842-78) were also painters. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal 1869</i>, p112, 1879, p48 (obit); A Dawson <i>The Life of Henry Dawson Landscape Painter</i> 1891; B Webber <i>James Orrock, RI, Painter, Connoisseur, Collector</i> 2 vols, 1903, I, pp25-42, II p237; H C Marillier <i>The Liverpool School of Painters</i> 1904, pp114-8, 259; H Williams <i>Henry Dawson</i> Nottingham University Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1978\n\n<b>Landscape</b> \n1857 -1900 Neg GG 1480 \nCanvas, 58.4 x 82.5 cm (23 x 32\u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated 'H Dawson 1840' \nAshbee Bequest 1900 \n\nNot identifiable with any exhibited work of 1840.
