He was the son of Mary Boleyn, sister of Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth's mother.  He had a prominent career as a courtier and soldier.  He played an important role in the suppression of the rebellion of the northern earls in 1570, was appointed Lord Chamberlain in 1586, and was a commissioner at the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots in 1587.  When the Armada threatened in 1588, he commanded Elizabeth's bodyguard at Tilbury in 1588.\n\nPlaces\nThis is one of the four Hunsdon jewels which have long been associated with  Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire and have been lent as a group to the British Galleries.
