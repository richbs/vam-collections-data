They were originally used to hide the signs of goitre, a disfiguring disease caused by lack of iodine, which was endemic in the high Alps. \n\nIn Switzerland these necklaces were usually made of strings of small facetted garnet beads interspersed by rectangular filigree plaques, sometimes set with garnets themselves.  This necklace was described as 18th century, from Uri, when it was acquired by the Museum in 1870.  Although it is made of filigree set with dark facetted stones, described as garnet, it is quite unlike the traditional Swiss necklace and lacks the three-part clasp typical of that design.  It may have been made in Switzerland in the 19th century as a fashion necklace, influenced by, but not copying, the traditional designs.",
