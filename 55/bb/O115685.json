It was believed to protect the wearer against the evil eye and was often worn by small children. In the mid 19th century, it began to be used in conventional jewellery. Coral was often carved into naturalistic shapes, popular in the period and set with intricate gold mounts. It comes in a variety of colours- pink to dark red, white, orange, blue to violet but the pale pink colour was the most highly prized. \n\nMost coral in Europe came from the sea around Naples and nearby Torre del Greco. In the 19th century it became a fashionable souvenir. This was partly because people could travel more once the Napoleonic wars had ended in 1815, but also due to the growing popularity of naturalistic jewellery in the 1850s.\n\nHowever, coral jewellery was not to everyone's taste. In 1867 when the craze for coral had waned a little, George Augustus Sala wrote that a few years previously people had gone about 'bedizened with twisted sticks of seeming red sealing-wax; and coral earrings had an unpleasant resemblance to fragments of ginger or orris-root'.",
