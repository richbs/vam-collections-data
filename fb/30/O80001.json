The way a woman dressed her hair was the most important way in which she proclaimed her marital status.  Unmarried women usually wore their hair loose or uncovered, while married women were allowed to put their hair up and decorate it with silver hair pins.\n\nThis pin comes from Dalmatia, and would have been part of a set of two or more which were worn at the side of the head, to secure a head scarf.  The filigree top is typical of Dalmatian filigree of the 19th century, but pins with similar tops were also worn in many other places in southern Europe.",
