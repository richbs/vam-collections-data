This miniature is a version of an oil painting (in the British Royal Collection) made in the studio of Bernart van Orley. King Henry VIII was married to the Emperor's aunt, Catherine of Aragon, and the Emperor probably sent the oil portrait as a gift to the Tudor court. Lucas Horenbout ((also known as Hornebolte) made other reduced copies of oil portraits, including a miniature of Henry VIII\u2019s grandmother, Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond. In 1534 Horenbout received a formal grant of the office of the King's painter, and on the same day became a \u2018denizen\u2019, a special form of citizenship granted to foreigners.",

Full Citation:\n\n\u201cLUCAS HORNEBOLTE\n\n<b>The Emperor Charles V</b>, 1525-30\n\n<i> Victoria & Albert Museum (P.22-1942)</i>\nVellum remounted onto modern card, circular, 42 mm. 1 5/8 in diam.\n\nThe miniature is after a portrait of the Emperor Charles V from the studio of Bernart van Orley still in the Royal Collection (O. Millar, <i>The Queen\u2019s Pictures</i>, London, 1977 pl. 3).  In the 1542 inventory of Genry VIII\u2019s pictures it is recorded as showing the Emperor \u201chis doublet being cutt and a rosemary braunch in his hand\u201d.  Henry VIII was marred to the Emperor\u2019s aunt Catherine of Aragon, and the oil portrait was doubtless sent as a gift.\n\nThis is not the only instance of Hornebolte making a reduction of an oil portrait and a similar piece exists of Henry VIII\u2019s grandmother, Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond (no. 13).  The alterations from the portrait are such as to contain the miniature within its circumference, e. g. the hat brim is noticeably smaller.  By the advent of the Divorce proceedings demand for the miniature of the Emperor would have evaporated.  It should therefore date to the last years of the 1520s.\n\nINSCRIBED: On the reverse the number: <i>276</i>.\n\nCOLLECTIONS: Sir Hans Sloane (1660-1753); recorded in his inventory under no. 276 as \u201cPhilip the 2d of Spain painted in miniature by Oliver\u201d; passed with his collection to the British Museum in 1754; transferred along with twenty-two other miniatures to the V&A, 1934.\u201d\n\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1942</u>, London: HMSO, 1955.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n'<b>ANONYMOUS: Flemish School, 16th century    </b>\n\nMiniature portrait of the Emperor Charles V (1500-1558).\n<i>On parchment.
