In the row above there are 3 slightly larger dark blue ground medallions which are more star-like; there are larger lozenges in between.  The rest of the ground is packed with small hexagons with a gold ground and a white flowerhead. All the motifs contain small red details. The dark blue ground medallions each contain a central gold star surrounded by a circular band with red dots and 8 small flowers.\nMetal Thread: gilt strip open S-wound on a yellow silk core.\nBorder: later in date and probably not Persian: dark red satin ground with a large peacock in blue, green, light yellow and purple which has faded to white. A stem with small flowers seems to form a lattice around the birds and there is a green rosette where the stems cross.\nBacking: pieced; white ground printed with a tiny purple flowerhead.\nFacing: bias cut; stripes; white and light brown stripes contain a meandering stem; red and blue stripes contain a small, isolated floral sprig.",
