The distinctive wave pattern was developed by Victoria Rutter during the course of her professional career, continuing a long tradition of design innovation among the professional quilting community.  \n\nThe printed linen used for the quilt top is part of a series designed by Timorous Beasties. Founded in Glasgow in 1990 by Alistair McAuley and Paul Simmons, the design studio experiments with both hand printing and machine production using textiles as the unsuspecting vehicle for uncompromisingly contemporary scenes. At first glance these appear to mirror the provincial scenes portrayed in eighteenth century toile-de-jouy textiles, but closer inspection reveals a nightmarish vision of modernity, where the homeless and dispossessed are depicted against a landscape of tower blocks and graveyards.",
