The design is for a fan mount, and was drawn about 1770-1790, possibly for an elite female client of the Court of Louis XV, King of France from 1715 to 1774, or of  Louis XVI, King of France from 1774 until 1791, at Versailles, Paris.  The design is possibly by the goldsmith Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Drais, active around 1761 to 1788. It is from an album of designs which date from about 1735 to 1820 and include snuffboxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, small swords, and chatelaines (ornamental chains, pins, or clasps usually worn at a woman's waist, to which trinkets, keys, purses, or other articles are attached). \n\nThere is a close relationship between the contents of the album and known work by three Parisian goldsmiths, Jean Ducrollay (1710-1787), Drais, and Charles Ouizille (1744-1830) whose names appear on the first page of the album. This suggests that all the designs emanate from their workshops.  Drais worked for the Court at Versailles as jeweller to both King Louis XV and Louis XVI. Ouizille worked in this capacity for Louis XVI. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.",
