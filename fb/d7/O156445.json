Engine-turning consists of a pattern created with the aid of a machine, rather than using hand-engraving. It can be carried out in straight or curved lines, allowing a variety of patterns to be produced, using straight-line or circular machines. Although the decoration is carried out with a machine, great skill is required from the operator to ensure that pieces are properly aligned and that an equal amount of pressure is applied. The letters 'LM' are probably a later addition. \n\nAs with many other boxes by Joseph-Etienne Blerzy, this box is numbered. The significance of these numbers is not yet known as they do not appear to relate to the date of manufacture.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
