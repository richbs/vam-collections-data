The custodia was a very large silver object used for religious processions such as the annual Corpus Christi ('body of Christ') parade. The Cuenca custodia was broken up when the cathedral was looted by French soldiers in 1808. \n\nAccording to legend, St Christopher showed his devotion to God by carrying travellers across a river. One day, he carried a child across the raging stream. Gradually the child grew heavier and heavier until Christopher felt as if he were carrying the whole weight of the world. When they arrived on the bank, the child revealed himself as Christ. In 1969, St Christopher was removed from the Catholic calendar of saints because of doubts as to his historical authenticity.",

This iconography would have been clearly understood in the past but it may be less familiar to modern eyes. \n\nThough often decorative, the symbols used on religious metalwork also refer to the function and significance of the objects. The contemplation of religious motifs can draw   believers into a deeper understanding of their faith. Complex theological themes can be represented in a visual form. A chalice, for example, might be adorned with the tools used in the Crucifixion (the \u2018Instruments of the Passion\u2019) to direct the viewer\u2019s mind towards Christ\u2019s sacrifice and his death on the cross.\n\nThe use of images has caused controversy throughout Christian history. While supporters held that imagery glorified God and helped believers understand their faith better, critics attacked its use as superstition and idolatry.\n\nSaints\nChristians venerate saints as men and women who, through the holiness of their lives, became especially close to God. The saints include martyrs who suffered and died for their faith as well as great teachers and preachers. Their lives provide an example and inspiration for the faithful. Roman Catholics also believe that saints can intercede on their behalf with God. In Christian iconography, saints are usually depicted with a distinctive object or \u2018attribute\u2019 associated with their martyrdom or works. For example, St Bartholomew, who was skinned alive, holds a flaying knife, and St George is shown with a dragon.",
