Before the introduction of hot drinks such as coffee and tea in the 1650s, such mugs were used for any type of liquid - beer, cider, even water. With its inscription and date, this piece may have been a christening mug.\n\nDesign & Designing\nSuch a plain form suits the coarse and soft earthenware, which needs to be thick to be sufficiently strong. Also, this forms provides the maximum surface area for decoration, and for the dedication around the rim.\n\nPeople\nChristian Wilhelm, in whose Pickleherring Quay factory at Southwark this mug was probably made, had moved into pottery making after dealing in cobalt (the blue mineral colour used for dyeing textiles as well as painting ceramics). It was natural therefore that his early products should be mainly blue and white. Yet it is worth noting that much early delftware made in London by Dutch immigrants was plain white. Unlike the painted and inscribed pieces, those cheap and popular tablewares have virtually all disappeared.",
