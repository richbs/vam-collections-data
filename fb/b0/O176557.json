            "public_access_description": "Effie Millais (b. 1858) was the daughter of Euphemia ('Effie') Chalmers Gray (1828-1897) and Sir John Everett Millais (1829-1896).  Her mother had previously married the art critic, author, poet and artist, John Ruskin (1819-1900), in 1846.  Shortly after their marriage, however, Ruskin introduced Euphemia to his friend and proteg\u00e9e, Millais, and while she modelled for Millais' painting, The Order of Release (1853), she fell in love with him.  Ruskin had been unwilling to consummate his marriage and, despite having been married for several years, Euphemia was still a virgin. In 1854, therefore, Euphemia annulled her marriage to Ruskin and married Millais the following year.  They had eight children, Effie their eldest daughter.  Effie was the model for her father\u2019s painting, The Minuet (1866).  She married Major William Christopher James and bore him a son, Willie James, who was the model for Millais\u2019 famous painting, Bubbles (1886).\n\nThe Millais family lived mostly in London but spent long summer holidays at Annet Lodge near Bowerswell, Perthshire.  Here, Millais executed many of his best known paintings and enjoyed the company of likeminded friends, including Rupert Potter (1832-1914), the father of the children's writer and illustrator, Beatrix Potter (1866-1943).  The Potters, too, spent many long summers in Perthshire, staying first at Dalguise House, then later at Eastwood, a large house on the bank of the Tay in Dunkeld.  An enthusiastic and skilled amateur photographer, Rupert photographed pleasant summer afternoons in the company of the Millais family; this photograph is one of several of Millais\u2019 daughter, Effie, taken at Eastwood in 1879.\n\nRupert also assisted Millais by photographing backgrounds for paintings and sitters for portraits.  Beatrix recounted one particularly memorable sitting in July 1884 when her father photographed the former prime minister, William Ewart Gladstone (1809-1898), for Millais\u2019 second portrait of him, completed in 1885: ' Papa has been photographing old Gladstone this morning at Mr. Millais'\u2026  They kept off politics of course, and talked about photography.  Mr. Gladstone talked of it on a large scale, but not technically.  What would it come to, how far would the art be carried, did papa think people would ever be able to photograph in colours?' (Journal, Monday 28th July 1884).",
