This image is similar to that shown on page 8 of the finished book, however it is quite different in some details, such as the road vehicles, the positioning of the elephant and appearance of the people and animals, and the colouring. This image has shading on the buildings of the town centre and more shadow on the road. Colours are more muted than the final piece, consisting mainly of monochrome, plus some yellows, reds and blues. The circus wagon is more brightly coloured than the other road vehicles so that it stands out. Two copies of the published book are at E.298:1-16-2007 and E.299:1-16-2007.",

This was the artist's first commission from Puffin books where the whole book, story and illustrations were made by her. Published in 1943, the book was reprinted many times. It shows the artist's lively but meticulous watercolour style and combines her skill at topography and figure drawing. Though best known as a topographical watercolour artist, whose skill led to her contribution to Pilgrim Trust\u2019s \u2018Recording Britain\u2019 project, Ginger's first ambition was to become an illustrator and she was prolific in the field. Her style often includes distinctive and lively sketches of people and street scenes, and can be seen in book covers for publishers such as Puffin, JM Dent and the magazine Harper's Bazaar, as well as pictorial advertisements. Ginger illustrated another children's story to feature a horse a few years later, 'The Mushroom Pony', written by Joan Lamburn.",
