The Baxter process, which he patented in 1835, involved an initial metal keyplate and up to 20 wood or metal blocks to apply each individual colour, and all this on hand presses. What stood out about George Baxter was the overall quality he endeavoured to achieve. He only used the best quality paper and mixed all his own oil inks. To gain perfect registration, alignment of all the blocks was an art in itself. Each colour or layer of oil ink was built up to achieve what was a miniature oil painting, art for the masses. Apart from the sale of 'Oil Pictures' his prints were used to illustrate books, his 'Cabinet of Paintings' was the first to be published in full colour, as well as music sheets, needleboxes, boxes for handkerchiefs, playing cards etc.\n(The George Baxter Society).",
