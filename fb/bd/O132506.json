The statutes of silk weaving guilds laid down the composition and structure of fabrics, and they could vary according to where they were made. The materials, technique and pattern sometimes determined the name of the fabric. This modest silk conforms to a type called camacas in the statutes for the city of Lucca in 1376. Some camacas were made of silk alone, others had small details brocaded in metal thread. It is possible that yet others were made with much more gold thread, just like those depicted in paintings by the Italian artist Bernardo Daddi (active 1312; d. 1348) in works such as the Anunciation from the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Six Saints in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.\n\nCamacas silks from Lucca, woven with vine patterns were exported. They are recorded in the English royal wardrobe accounts in the 1320s, and in 14th-century inventories from Italy and France. In 1369, Pisa cathedral had an altar frontal of 'red and green Lucchese camacas worked with vines and grapes'.",

But these same leaves are found in Bernardo Daddi's paintings of pre-1348, so that an earlier dating for this and other similar examples is possible'. It may tentatively be attributed to Lucchese manufacture; camacas silks from Lucca woven with vine patterns are recorded in the Englihs royal wardrobe accounts of the 1320s, in 14th-century inventoires from Italy and France, including one recorded in Pisa cathedral in 1369 (an altar frontal of 'red and green Lucchese camacas worked with vines and grapes'.",
