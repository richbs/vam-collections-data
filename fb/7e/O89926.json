They formed part of a block acquisition of 89 pieces of sculpture and majolica. These came from two collections assembled by Ottavio Gigli and Giovan Pietro Campana during the period 1825-50.\n\nThese three reliefs are related to another of the Creation of Eve, which is now in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence. We think that they are the only surviving pieces of a series concerning the Old Testament story of Adam and Eve. The complete set may have numbered six, if there were also panels of the Creation of Adam and the Temptation.",
