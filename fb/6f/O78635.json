The sculptural elements were a popular feature of clocks of the period.\n\nTime\nThe gilt-bronze figure of a mounted North African warrior, the military trophies and the palm leaves that ornament the clock reflect the French colonial ambitions of the period. North Africa held a particular allure and writers such as Alphonse Daudet (1840-1897)  used the area as a setting for novels.\n\nManufacturing & Trade\nThe clock movement was made by Japy Fr\u00e8res, who were the largest and most commercially significant clockmakers in France in the 19th century. Although mass-produced, the clocks were of a high quality and the firm won prizes at many national and international exhibitions. The clock case may have been retailed by H.Y. Marc, who may also have made clocks as well as selling them. Japy Fr\u00e8res certainly supplied other clocks to H.Y. Marc, but the clock case is very coarse, which suggests that it came from a different supplier.",
