Many such chairs were made in the Thames valley, an area around the river to the West of London, where plentiful beech woods provided the raw materials.  The name probably derives from the town of Windsor, situated on the river Thames and therefore ideally located as a distribution point. Windsor chairs were, however, also produced in many other areas of Britain during the 18th and 19th centuries. A Windsor chair is characterised by its construction; the seat is of solid wood, with legs and arm-supports dowelled into it. Relatively cheap to make and light to move, Windsor chairs were made from the early 18th century but in greater numbers during the 19th century.  Early Windsor chairs can sometimes be seen in paintings of gardens dating from the mid-18th century.  For outdoor use they were usually painted for protection from damp, and would have been stored under cover.",
