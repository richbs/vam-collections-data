The gnomon is missing: there is a star shaped device in the centre, and a scalloped border. Below are two kneeling angels supporting the dial on their wings and holding between them a heraldic shield.\n\nThe position of the numerals indicates that they were incised at a later date, when the dial was being used horizontally and in London, because the numerals are so placed that the dial could tell the correct time only if used horizontally and in the London area. If used vertically, as presumably was originally intended, the numerals would be differently arranged. There are traces of painted numerals (undecipherable) and these may be the original ones.",
