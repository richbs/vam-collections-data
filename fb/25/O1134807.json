            "public_access_description": "This suit was designed for Yves Saint Laurent's Rive Gauche line. It was worn by the donor for her 50th birthday party tea at the Dorchester Hotel, London. The suit's soft cream colour lends a gentleness to a traditionally masculine garment.\n\nThe first Rive Gauche shop was opened on the left bank of the River Seine in Paris in 1966, and offered ready-to-wear at more affordable prices than Saint Laurent's couture designs. The hand-sewing on this tailored jacket is typical of the high quality of Saint Laurent's couture garments, but the incorporation of slightly lower quality fabrics ensures that the suit fits into Rive Gauche's more affordable price range. Saint Laurent came to fame at the young age of 21 when he became the designer for couture house Christian Dior upon the designer's death in 1957. In 1961 Saint Laurent launched his own label. This three-piece suit is an example of the fine tailoring often seen in his early designs. Saint Laurent's tailored suits were androgynous yet chic; he is often credited with making the trouser suit fashionable for women.",
