This creation by Edward Molyneux has its double-tiered, full skirt held out by four bone hoops.  \n\nThe dress was worn by Stella, Lady Ednam, and forms part of the Cecil Beaton Collection. This Collection was brought together by the society photographer Sir Cecil Beaton (1904-1980). With great energy and determination Beaton contacted the well-dressed elite of Europe and North America to help create this lasting monument to the art of dress. The Collection was exhibited in 1971, accompanied by a catalogue that detailed its enormous range.",
