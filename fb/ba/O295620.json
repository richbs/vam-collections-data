Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nBodice fasteners originated in the Middle Ages, as a way of fastening the front opening of the bodice.  Women made holes on either side of the bodice, and then laced them together with a cord running through the holes, in the same way that people still lace their shoes.  Because of their prominent position on the front of the costume, the holes were often decorated with embroidery, or replaced with silver eyelets or bodice fasteners, like these.   \n\nMany of the designs used in Sk\u00e5ne bodice fasteners have remained unchanged for generations.  This bodice fastener is small and made of cast silver, in the medieval style, although it was probably made in the first half of the 19th century.  It is decorated with a standing winged figure, possibly a stylised angel.",
