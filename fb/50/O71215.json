Wedgwood, however, was the first person to manufacture them in stoneware on a commercial scale.\n\nUse\nThis medallion of Wedgwood himself was made as the pair to one of his partner Thomas Bentley (museum no. 453-1890). They were made for personal reasons and were probably not intended to be reproduced commercially. The earliest of these medallions were probably given to close friends of the two partners. Later, after the firm had become famous, others were made using the original moulds. They were probably hung on walls in wood or brass frames or stored in cabinets.\n\nPeople\nJosiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) was one of the most remarkable entrepreneurs and innovators of the 18th century. The foundation of his commercial empire, and of his great reputation as a potter and businessman, was the several ceramic materials and decorative treatments he developed or perfected. The most important of these were Black Basalt, Jasper and 'Queen's Ware.' Prompted by Thomas Bentley, he was swift to exploit the new Neo-classical style, introducing new ceramic materials and products in order to satisfy this shift in taste. His factory at Etruria became one of the industrial marvels of the day.",
