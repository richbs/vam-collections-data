This mahasiddah, known as Tilopa, was a spiritual adviser to the court of southern India.  He renounced his post and retired to a cemetry close to Kanchipuram, where he attained siddhi (complete understanding of the supernatural forces).  As was typical of many of the mahasiddhas, he is portrayed with long hair, gathered at the top of the head and adorned with flowers, and in an attitude of prayer sitting on a meditation mat made of animal skin.\nOne of the characteristics common to many of these statues which is worth mentioning, including this example, is the portrait style of representation.   Traditionally, they are remembered as very respected persons, desite the fact that their social and moral conduct would eventually be described as scandalous.  Only by using these human qualities they did achieve their spiritual goals which, for other human beings,  were attainable.",

This sculpture bears the inscription \"Praise to Avadudhipa...\"; also known as Tilopa, he renounced his richly endowed post as guru to a king in the land of Bhigunagara (?) and retreated to a cemetary near Kancipuram where he attained siddhi.  Mahasiddhas are recognised by their uncut hair which is often decorated with flowers, their ascetic attire and the use of  an animal skin mat.",
