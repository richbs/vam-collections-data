Scorer, Newhaven, Sussex, for \u00a350 in 1958.\n\nHistorical significance: This bronze monument was commisioned in 1476 by the church elders, and completed in 1479 by the founder Claus Grude (active 1466-93) after models provided by the goldsmith Claus Rughese (active 1469-about 1491) (Rosenberg 1923, no. 3156; Hasse 1983, pp. 99-100, fig. 53.2). Although the present piece represents a different iconographic type (the Man of Sorrows in L\u00fcbeck points with his left hand to the wound in his side), and is of a different size (h. approximately 45cm), the facture (it is also a solid cast), and certain details, such as the distinctive rib-cage and the facial features, closely link the pieces in London and L\u00fcbeck, and they may have originated in the same workshop in L\u00fcbeck.",
