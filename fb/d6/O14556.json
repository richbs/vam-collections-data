Koseto ware was produced in a wide range of shapes, frequently modelled after imported Chinese ceramics. This piece is closely based on contemporary white porcelains from kilns in southern China. The distribution of sites where Koseto wares have been found by archaeologists indicates that they enjoyed a particularly lively market in areas of the country where Chinese ceramics were either unavailable or expensive.",
