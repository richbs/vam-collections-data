Salt was a precious commodity in 16th-century England, valued both as a preservative and a flavouring. \n\nHistory & Use\nFrom the late medieval period a large ceremonial covered salt, or 'great' salt, was placed on the high table at the host's side. This distinguished the status of the diners, who sat either 'above' or 'below' the salt. Smaller salts were arranged around the tables, next to the trenchers, or plates. These are known as 'trencher' salts. Great salts were common by the mid 16th century, but were still an important part of household silver, valued as high status objects, exchanged as New Year's gifts and passed on as heirlooms. \n\nDesign\nThe ceremonial function of great salts ensured that they were ornamented in the very latest fashions. This example is decorated with motifs characteristic of the late Renaissance, such as strapwork, masks, flowers and fruit.",

It is of very unusual size; and important both from an historical and art point of view- its manufacture is of the most characteristic and elaborate kind and of a high degree of excellence, both in this way and on account of its finish. It must have been the state cellar of the house of Mostyn and an object of importance even amongst the other important pieces of plate. The salt is of London make and of the year 1586-7.' (letter 29 July 1885)\n\nOn 14 May 1886 Mr Mortimer Hunt of Messrs Hunt &amp; Roskill called to examine the salt with a view to repairing it 'without the use of fire'- it was accordingly sent to their premises  156 New Bond Street for repair.",
