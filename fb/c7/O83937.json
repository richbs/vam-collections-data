In the 1970s as women adopted trousers and men became more comfortable with colour and pattern fashion blurred gender. In this tuxedo Anthony Price adopts the fabric and components of a man\u2019s dinner suit to a woman\u2019s figure.  With a nipped-in waist, and designed to be worn with nothing beneath, the suit is an overtly sexy version of the male original. Price trained at the Royal College of Art, graduating in 1968. His designs became associated with the glam-rock style of the 1970s, producing clothes for Roxy Music. After setting up his own label in 1979, he became renowned for producing glamorous yet carefully constructed clothes.",
