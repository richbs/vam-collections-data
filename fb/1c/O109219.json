It is only the opaque glaze that gives an immediate clue, for all other details are meticulously copied.  Most impressively the potters managed to give the pieces the required heavy weight, which earlier copies never achieved.",

Often, as here, they used single- colour glazes. Many of these wares have moulded or carved decoration, as on the rim of this piece.\n \nIn the 16th century, ceramic production in Iran was on a modest scale. When the capital moved to Isfahan around 1600, the production of luxury dishes and wall tiles in a wide variety of styles and techniques rapidly increased.\n\nWe cannot identify a particular centre of production of ceramic vessels. Surviving pieces illustrate the many techniques the potters used. These included underglaze painting and coloured glazes, and lustre, which was revived after 1650.",
