This allowed for a group of women to work on individual panels at the same time. If required, the hanging could be dismantled at a later stage and the panels re-used. In the case of this hanging it seems likely that the panels were left unused until the 17th century.\n\nPeople\nIt is very rare to be able to identify surviving embroideries as having been owned or worked by royalty. Unfortunately for the doomed Mary, Queen of Scots, she had plenty of time while imprisoned to work on numerous  embroideries, some of which have her initials or cipher. This activity must have both filled her time and occupied her mind as many of the emblems or mottoes used have more significance than is immediately apparent.",
