The front is gilded and overlaid with filigree, which is nailed to the back plate.  The filigree overlay is set with a central facetted red stone, surrounded by four similar smaller (one missing).\n[belt ends] Two rectangular parts of a clasp, gilded on the front and decorated with applied filigree and garnets.  Each part consists of a plain back plate, gilded on the front, to which is pinned a sheet of open filigree.  The filigree is set with six facetted garnets in plain cylindrical mounts which are pinned through the back plate, holding the filigree in place. One garnet is missing from each piece.  One end of each piece is slightly curved, and the other has a shallow wide rectangular loop attached, to hold the central circular part.  There are four small holes along the curved section of each piece, and one on each side of the loop, to allow it to be sewn to the belt.",

Its traditional jewellery often retains many medieval characteristics lost elsewhere. \n\nThe belt was one of the main pieces of jewellery which a woman owned.  They were usually richly decorated with silver, made into cast or filigree appliqu\u00e9s or links.  The shape of the clasp on this belt, a central roundel between two rectangular side pieces, is typically Icelandic.  But the detail of the filigree and the presence of facetted red stones are both unusual, as is the embroidery on the belt.  Icelandic belts are more usually made of plain velvet, sometimes bordered with metal cord.  It was described as 17th century Icelandic metalwork, on a belt with modern embroidery, when it was acquired in 1872.",
