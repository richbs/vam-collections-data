Two pieces have been seamed to form the section added to the left hand side [if the Museum Number is in the lower left hand corner] before being embroidered. \nThere are an inner and an outer border with unconnected red 5-petalled flowers between a light green stem and separate leaf. The main border has red and pink circular blossoms with a light blue centre alternating with a light blue iris outlined in red.  Trailing between them are light green stems, dark green leaves, red 5-petalled flowers.  Yellow trefoil flowers edged in dark red face inward from the sides of this border.\nIn the centre is an 8-pointed star with a white outline [there are 2 lines in one place] and a floral sprig at each angle; these are red outlined with pink except at the compass points which are light blue outlined in red.  Thin red serrated leaves outlined in white form an inner star.  In the centre is a red rosette within a ring of yellow and red trefoils.  Green leaves form a circle of arched compartments each containing a pink and red flower.  More leaves form a floral sprig at each point with a pair of light blue flowers and a large yellow one.  A quarter of this design is in each corner but the placement of the colours is different.\nThe quilting goes through all the layers and is worked in opposed diagonal lines meeting down the central vertical axis.\nEmbroidery Thread: silk, cannot determine twist or ply: dark red, pink, dark green, light green, light blue, yellow, white.\nBacking: pieced; dark brown ground with a half-drop repeat of a boteh which has green roots with a red circle and green leaves with two stems above with 3 central red spots and 3 orange spots to either side.  In the middle of the boteh is a circular blossom in 2 shades of red and the upper half of the boteh is formed by many small white stems and flowers with red details.\nFacing: bias cut dark blue silk.\nFringe: looped green silk from a woven heading; Two types have been used -there is one short section of brighter green.",
