He sits on a western-style chair typical of those in use at the Sikh court at this time. His Hindu companion, Dhian Singh (1796\u20131843), Ranjit Singh\u2019s prime minister, is seated at his feet. Nau Nihal Singh was Ranjit Singh\u2019s favourite grandson and took part in military expeditions on his behalf. After Ranjit Singh\u2019s death in 1839, Nau Nihal\u2019s father, Kharak Singh, became maharaja, but immediately became caught up in factional rivalries at court and was soon the victim of plotting by the Dogra family, which included Dhian Singh. Dhian Singh and his supporters were involved in the poisoning of Kharak Singh and, on the day of his death, also murdered Nau Nihal Singh.\n\nThis painting was formerly in the Collection of Lord Auckland, Governor-General of India from 1836 to 1842. It was given to the V&A in 1953 by his great-nephew, O.E. Dickinson.",
