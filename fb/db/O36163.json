The whole is lithographed to represent a light brown horse with brown; red and yellow trim and a JAPANESE cowboy in green; red; white; yellow and blue. The tail and ears are shaped pieces of leather. The rider holds a long metal bar in its right hand which is attached to the mechanism. It may be that it should spark or move when wound up. The horse is in a comic stance galloping with its mouth open. The whole is on two concealed drive wheels with a third wheel at the front for balance. The mechanism is contained within the body itself. The winding bar protrudes from the left side of the body.\n*It is marked with the makers mountain logo and the name ALPS and a second mark of a cut away circle within a ring and the words MADE IN JAPAN. The company; which made a number of novelty toys; was founded in 1948. \n*This is very unusual because of the use of an oriental face.",
