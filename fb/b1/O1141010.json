This was made as the result of a road trip Besant made across Canada in 2005; staying at low-priced road-side hotels along the way; each morning he would take the opportunity to photograph any vacated rooms before the maids arrived to clean them. There is a voyeuristic quality to these stolen images of intimate spaces. The impact is heightened by the life-size scale of the works. They are photo-based images printed onto crumpled nylon scrim using thermal inks. The artist manipulated some aspects of each image, with white contour drawing, and the accentuation of certain features - a lamp, a headboard, a patterned bedspread.\n\n The prints are designed to be displayed unframed, supported only by pins at the top edge, so that they float free, and the lighting produces shadows of the imagery on the wall behind, enhancing their ethereal film noir quality, and the sense of a fleeting moment remembered as if in a dream. The prints were part of a larger installation which included sound and text, which offered various narratives, but the images invite the viewer to imagine their own.",
