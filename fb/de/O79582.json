It comes from two pairs in the V&A intended to be placed on a dining table and viewed from all sides.\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nThe stems are formed of female and male figures that also support the candle sockets. The nymph Daphne  is fleeing the amorous advances of the Olympian god Apollo, the male figure. She finally escapes by turning into a laurel tree, symbolising the victory of Chastity over Desire. Figural candlesticks had been known in antiquity and were popular in Europe from the 16th century.\n\n\n\nPeople\n\nThe Daphne figure on one of the candlesticks appears to be based on an original design (also in the V&A)  by the renowned Swiss-born gold chaser George Michael Moser (1706-1783). No equivalent design for the Apollo figure has been traced. Moser's Daphne derives from the famous and much-reproduced sculptural group Apollo and Daphne by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, made in 1625 for the Galleria Borghese, Rome. The bold scrollwork and marine theme of the bases show the clear influence of the ornamental designs of Juste-Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier (1695-1750), a celebrated exponent of the Rococo who worked in Paris. Moser and his fellow artist members of the St Martin's Lane Academy in London are credited with the dissemination of the Rococo style in England.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nThe conceit of a candlestick designed as a figure holding a candlestick is an ancient one, although the earliest such forms to survive in silver date only from the late seventeenth century. This pair, unusually refined in design and modelling, takes its subject from Greek mythology: the nymph Daphne, amorously pursued by the Olympian god Apollo, prays for rescue and is transformed into a laurel tree by Gaea, the primal goddess, the mother of all things.\nFelicitously, the Apollo and Daphne Candlesticks related to a drawing by George Michael Moser already in the V&A collection, thus making the pair an especially desirable acquisition. There are many works in the Museum collection that are represented by original design drawings, offering rich opportunity for firsthand comparisons between an object's design and its final form. Acquisition of the Moser candlesticks, however, also marked a shift of aesthetic attitude. Until at least the 1960s, this type of English Rococo work had been dismissed by V&A curators as no more than an interesting aberration.\nAlthough Moser's drawing for the Daphne candlestick (fig. 116) has been described \"more as a pleasant jeu d'esprit of the artist than as a sober design for execution by a working goldsmith,\" the drawing nonetheless attributes the design to this Swiss modeller and enameller who taught life drawing in London at St. Martin's Lane Academy. Founded as a drawing school for artists and craftsmen in 1735, the Academy was one of the key centres for exploring and disseminating new design ideas in England. As scholarly work on the English Rococo developed, the Academy's members-including Moser-were increasingly seen as important for an understanding of this style.\n\nLit.
