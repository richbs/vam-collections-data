            "public_access_description": "Earthenware flatbacks and figurines for mantelpiece decoration were first produced in Staffordshire in the late 1830s, and the earliest datable Staffordshire figures appear to be those of Queen Victoria. Images of royalty proved lucrative and during the 1840s countless other royal figures were issued by Staffordshire pottery firms. Although some Staffordshire portrait figures were produced after Victoria's death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905. During their heyday however they were made in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. As well as the royal family they represented a wide variety of subjects, actors and actresses being especially popular.\nFigures C.50 and 51-2013 represent 'Yourawkee' and 'Peter Wilkins' from The Life and Adventures of Peter Wilkins, a drama adapted from a novel by Robert Paltock (1697-1767). The play made it's debut at the Theatre Royal Covent Garden in 1827. Wlkins becomes shipwrecked in Antarctica on an island inhabited by fairy creatures called 'Gawries' and 'Glums'. One of these creatures Yourawkee, falls into Wilkin's hut, they then fall in love and marry. C.51-2013 is based on a print published by Thomas McLean, Haymarket, 1827, inscribed; Mrs Vining in the Character of Peter Wilkins. The pair to this piece C.50-2013 probably shows the Actress Miss Mary Glover as 'Yourawkee'.\n",
