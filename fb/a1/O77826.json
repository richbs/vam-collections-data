They have a fleecy lining and elasticated wrists, which would have helped keep out the wet and cold.\n\nDesign & Designing\nMen's gloves did not change much in style in the late 19th century, but manufacturers such as Fownes did try to introduce novelties to extend the range and make their products more attractive to the purchaser.  These gloves, for example, are patented with a long continuous thumb. (Most gloves were constructed with a thumb section that was separately stitched on.) In 1896 Fownes introduced a patent button on which the wearer could strike a match, and in 1897 the company advertised a glove with ribbed fingers for driving, which they promoted with the slogan 'Reins Cannot Slip, Rain or Shine'.\n\nMaterials & Making\nMen's gloves came in various subdued shades to suit the clothing and time of day. Fawn kid or grey suede were popular with frock or morning coats, or at weddings. Tan gloves were often worn with lounge suits.  For evening wear plain white or cream suede gloves with black stitching were de rigueur.",
