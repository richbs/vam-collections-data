In 1524 he made sonnets based on engravings of the erotic drawings of Giulio Romano (1499-1546) and this forced him to leave Rome, followed by anti-papal satires a year later, which forced him to stay away from Rome permanently. He thus settled in Venice in 1527. He got an international acclaim for his political, humorous, satirical and religious writings. His writings went onto the list of prohibited books. This medal shows him at the age of 60.\nAlessandro Vittoria (1525-1608) was an Italian sculptor, stuccoist and architect. In the second half of the 16th century he became one of the most important sculptors active in Venice.",
