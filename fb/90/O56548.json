The public and most collectors of modern works started to prefer lighter and sometimes more sentimental themes.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThis painting is an illustration to John Milton's 1632 poem 'L'Allegro' where he is calling upon Euphrosyne, the goddess of Mirth 'So buxom, blithe and debonair'. The goddess is shown closing her ear with her hand against the counsels of love. It is a companion work to Cope's Il Penseroso also described here.\n\nPeople\nCharles West Cope (1811-1890) was a landscape watercolourist as well as an oil painter. He was a friend of the collector John Sheepshanks who gave nine of Cope's works to the Museum. Nearly all his paintings were literary, biblical or historical subjects and domestic genre. He studied fresco painting in Italy and painted several frescos in the Palace of Westminster.  Cope exhibited 134 works at the Royal Academy and in 1870 was appointed examiner in painting at the South Kensington Schools of Art, the forerunner of the Royal College of Art.",

Briefly at school in London, then Leeds Grammar School. Returned to London 1827 to study at Sass's art school and 1828 at RA Schools. Travelled to Paris 1832 and Italy 1833-5. Exhibited 134 works at the RA between 1833 and 1882, 14 at the BI 1836--43, and one at the SBA 1837. Nearly all his paintings were literary, biblical or historical subjects and domestic genre; the fact that he was Roman Catholic may explain his choice of many of the subjects. Founder member of the Etching Club in about 1840. Awarded one of the three first prizes in the 1843 competition for the new Palace of Westminster decorations with 'An Early Trial by Jury'; travelled again to Italy to study fresco painting before painting several frescos at Westminster. Elected ARA 1843, RA 1848; appointed Professor of Painting at the RA 1867, and examiner in painting for the South Kensington Schools of Art 1870. Visited America and Canada 1876. Died Bournemouth, Hampshire, 21 August 1890. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1869, ppl77-9; CH Cope <i>Reminiscences of Charles West Cope</i> RA 1891 (referred to below as <i>Reminiscences</i>) \n\n<b>L'Allegro</b> \nFA58 Neg 54207 \nPanel, 71.1 x 46.4 cm (28 x 18\u00bc ins) \nSigned and dated 'C W Cope 1848' br \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1848 (the year of the artist's election to full Academician), and according to the <i>Reminiscences</i> sold to John Sheepshanks before the exhibition opened. Appended to the title in the RA catalogue was line 24 of Milton's 1632 poem: 'So buxom, blithe, and debonair'. Milton is calling upon Euphrosyne the goddess of Mirth. It is a companion to 'Il Penseroso' (see FA59, p49), which is painted on canvas. \n\nThe <i>Art Union</i> commented: \n\nTo his conception of Euphrosyne (so called in Heaven) the artist adds a pleasant and original conceit, that of the nymph determinedly closing her ear with her hand against the counsels of Love; and thus are illustrated in the lines 'Haste thee nymph, and bring with thee/Jest and youthful Jollity,/Quips and Cranks, and wanton Wiles,/Nods and Becks, and Wreathed Smiles' [lines 25-8]. There is a classic taste in the reading of the subject, which consists with the spirit of the verse. The drapery of the figure is blue, but it clings too closely to the form, which downwards would have been improved and supported by greater breadth. It is however a production of a high degree of merit; indeed, to realise after Milton with any amount of success, is an evidence of no common standard. \n\nFor the <i>Examiner's</i> comments, see FA59.\n \nWhile Waagen in 1854 thought 'The brilliant colouring of this attractive picture shows the study of Paul Veronese and of Mulready', Pointon in 1970 considered it, and 'Il Penseroso', 'very sentimental'. \n\nEXH: RA 1848 (240) \n\nLIT: <i>Examiner</i> 1848, p325; <i>Art Union</i> 1848, p170; <i>Reminiscences</i> p379; G Waagen <i>Treasures of Art in Great Britain</i> 1854, 11, p305; M Pointon <i>Milton and English Art</i> 1970, p208 \n\nREPR: F T Palgrave <i>Gems of English Art</i> 1869, colour frontispiece\"",
