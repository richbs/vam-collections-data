Sweden had grown prosperous from trading amber, furs, timber and grain around the Baltic Sea and by the 18th century was a major power in northern Europe. Foreign travellers frequently noted that silver ownership was more widespread than they had expected. Even small landowners might own a few silver spoons or beakers.\n\nGustavus III became King of Sweden in February 1771. Although this beaker bears a mark for the year 1770, perhaps the cipher G III was added for a loyal subject during the coronation year. The goldsmith, Johan Christoffer Jungmarker (1721-1810), became a master at Gothenburg in 1752 and was in business there until 1779, when he moved to Marstrand.",
