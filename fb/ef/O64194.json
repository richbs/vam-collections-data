Robe over both shoulders.\n\nA figure of Buddha seated in a meditation posture on a lotus pedestal, with hands in dharmacakramudra, expounding the Buddhist law (dharma), an event which took place in the deer park at Sarnath. He wears the close-fitting robes of a monk, over both shoulders, only visible by the carved hems at the neck, on his sleeves and at his wrists, and in the two hems above his ankles with a double row of folds of the lower edges of the robes radiating from under his crossed feet. His eyes are downcast under the arching lines of his eyebrows . There is a projecting circular urna in the middle of his forehead under rows of snail-shell curls which rise to a damaged ushnisha on top. He has long concave-curving ears and the distinguishing three rings round his neck.\n\nThis sculpture was designed to occupy a wall niche in a Buddhist monastery, perhaps around the base of stupa, as witnessed by those still in situ at the Mahabodhi temple, Bodhgaya. It was acquired at Patna in the 1880s by A H Giles, a government officer serving in Gaya at the time Alexander Cunningham was undertaking excavations at Bodhgaya and the restoration of the Mahabodhi temple. In all likelihood this quintessential Buddha image was recovered from one of the monastic site in the region, perhaps Bodhgaya or Sarnath, and was brought to Britain.",

ISBN 9788476649466\nThe Buddha Shakyamuni\nEastern India (probably Bodhgaya)/ 9th or 10th century\nGrey sandstone/ 38cm high\n\nA Buddha is recognized, in addition to his spiritual qualities, by physical characteristics that distinguish him from ordinary men. These include the lump on the top of the head ('ushnisha'), spot between the eyes ('urna'), and webbed fingers. Except for the 'ushnisha', which is usually conventional, they are not always shown on images.\nFor figures similar to this, in slightly earlier style, see Banerji [1933] pl.VIIb and d.",

It was acquired at Patna in the 1880s by A H Giles, Superintendent of Police in Gaya District at the time Alexander Cunningham was undertaking excavations at Bodhgaya and the restoration of the Mahabodhi temple, together with ten other pieces (IS.239-248-1950). In all likelihood this quintessential Buddha image was recovered from one of the monastic sites in the region, perhaps Bodhgaya or Sarnath, and was brought to Britain.",
