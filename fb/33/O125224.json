The design is clearly Hayman's (the boy hanging by his leg from the branch to the left and the anguished face of his companion on the right are characteristic), but French influence is strong in the central group and in the landscape setting. The execution is softer than in any other surviving picture; the hand of a French assistant may be suspected, but the final touches of drawing in the central group (now a little rubbed) seem to be by Hayman.\"",
