The red silk is densely covered with couched metal thread forming offset rows of a 'pineapple' motif on a stem with fronds. The design is directional on both back and front which means the direction of the motifs was reversed along the line which forms the base of the purse. The 'pineapple' shape is worked in silver thread couched in a basket-weave pattern while the fronds and stem are silver-gilt couched with yellow silk. All the motifs are outlined with the silver metal thread.\nThe sides of the purse are edged with a row of silver-gilt strip couched over padding and then a black and silver cord.\nMetal Thread: silver strip close S-wound on white silk core and silver-gilt strip wound on a yellow silk core.\nLining: [1] inside the purse, red/orange silk; [2] on the triangular flap: a European woven silk with a white ground enhanced with a warp of silver-gilt strip and patterned with a tree trunk meander in light blue and black, bearing flowering plants  in pink and purple with light blue leaves.",
