The Museum Number is in the top right hand corner. There is a border along the bottom: straight striped stem with pink blossom pointing to the lower right alternating with a straight striped stem with 3 pale blossoms pointing to the top right.  This is edged with dark green but down the sides and part way up the sides of the panel there is a border in which a row of outward facing pointed arches have a dark green half and a pink or yellow half - rather like a bowl of fruit.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in green and dark blue.\n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: large pink blossom pointing to the lower right alternating with light blue iris on an angled striped stem pointing either to the top right or bottom left.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] white ground with an angled chequered stem with pointed pink flower pointing down and edged in light blue with 7 small pale flowers forming a diamond around its upper edge alternating with a mass of flowers with no discernable stem and with small blue flowers in the centre.\n[b] White ground, seems to have 3 designs within diamond segments but without a visible structure: there is a central pink rosette with light blue spots and a group of 3 small light blue flowers to the upper left; 3 star-like blue flowers along the top edge of the band with a downward pointing dark green edged pink flower below; 3 star-like light blue flowers along the lower edge of the band with a blue flower pointing up.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; light blue, blue, dark blue, yellow, green, dark green, red, pink, white, light green.",
