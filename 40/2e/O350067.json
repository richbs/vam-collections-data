            "public_access_description": "This medal depicts the bust of Giovanna Albizzi, wife of Lorenzo Tornabuoni. The Albizzi family was an influential Florentine family at that time. On the reverse are the Three Graces depicted from an antique model as naked women. The Three Graces were the daughters of Zeus and companions to the Muses: Thalia (youth and beauty), Euphrosyne (mirth), Aglaia (elegance). The Three Graces symbolize what is good and most civilized in life, and the interlacing of the figures is associated with the acts of giving, accepting and returning. This medal was probably made for the occasion of their marriage or shortly after. The necklace of pearls confirms that the sitter was a bride, the pearls being a symbol for the immaculate Virgin.\nThe medallist was Niccolo Fiorentino (also called Niccolo di Forzore Spinelli) grand newphew of the painter Spinello Aretino, was born in Florence of a family of goldsmiths of the Popolo of S. Maria Novella. It is possible that he is identical with the 'Nicolas de Spinel' who was mentioned in 1468 in the accounts of the Dukes of Burgundy as having engraved seals for Charles the Bald.",
