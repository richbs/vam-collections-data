Although the precise method was not mastered by 19th century goldsmiths a similar effect was achieved.\n\nIntellectuals particularly admired archaeological-style jewellery, often closely copied from surviving finds, from around 1860 until at least the 1880s. \nCarlo Giuliano, a Neapolitan by birth, worked for the great Castellani firm in Italy before moving to London in about 1860. His early work in London closely resembles Castellani's productions in the classical manner. He later evolved a distinctive style of his own, using stones and enamel to create rich polychromatic effects.  Carlo Giuliano's first mark, 'CG' in monogram, was based on the monogram of the Castellani firm.",
