The Queen was an avid collector of jewellery, fans and miniature furniture for which she commissioned several dolls' houses, as well as objects with a royal association.  However, she was also one of the earliest collectors of Victorian decorative arts such as papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and embroidery, many examples of which she lent or gave to the V&A for the Victorian Galleries. This firescreen is a good example of just the sort of decorative domestic object that appealed to the Queen.  \n\nThe screen is decorated with Berlin work or woolwork, a technique sometimes used for furnishings and especially popular in the nineteenth century for pictorial embroidery.  The name for this sort of work is derived from the type of wool used for it.  Berlin wool, also known as Berlin yarn or German wool, was a high quality worsted yarn spun from combed wool, with a harder twist than other yarns.  Here cross-stitch has been used to depict most of the foliage in the picture, whereas different techniques have been adopted to represent the varying textures of the vase, pedestal and blooms.  The harder surfaces such as the vase and pedestal have been worked with beads, giving them a sheen not possible with wool.  The flowers themselves are in cut pile which adds depth to the picture while emphasising the shape and colour of the flowers themselves.",
