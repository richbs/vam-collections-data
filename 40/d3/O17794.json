In Crome's day it was still unsurrounded by modern suburbs, and was a favourite place for artists to paint and sketch; Cotman painted a water-colour of the scene that is now in the Castle Museum at Norwich. The Norwich school of painters was the most lively and talented of all local societies of painters that flourished in England in the early 19th century. Crome was its undisputed leader, having been a founding member of the Norwich Society of Artists in 1803. \n\n<i>View on Mousehold Heath</i> may be the picture that Crome exhibited at the Norwich Society in 1812 as <i>Boy Keeping Sheep: Morning</i>. Crome shows us a shepherd boy on a hillock of the heath silhouetted against the sky with his dog and his sheep below him. The vastness of the heath is glimpsed through a crack in the low-lying ground on the right. Such a mundane subject is Dutch in inspiration, but the colours are clear and bright and painted in broad bands of colour that suggest the influence of Richard Wilson, then one of the most respected painters amongst innovative landscape-painters of the early 19th century. The composition may be based on a plate from Gainsborough's <i>English Scenery</i>, etched by W F Wells and published in 1803-4. \n\nIn a famous letter to his pupil James Stark in 1816, Crome gave some account of the principles that governed his art. A painter should aim at breadth of handling and avoid details, 'forming one grand plan of light and shade, this must always please a good eye and keep the attention of the spectator and give delight to everyone. Trifles in Nature must be overlooked that we may have our feelings raised by seeing the whole picture at a glance, not knowing how or why we are so charmed.' In his fluid handling of the paint Crome has produced a picture that is not so much of a shepherd-boy and his sheep as of infinite light and space. \n\nHoward Coutts\"\nGoldberg, Norman L. <u>John Crome the elder</u>.

Photograph in the W.L. and F.A.R.L.\n \nNotes: The picture represents a view on the outskirts of Norwich, with a shepherd boy tending sheep on Mousehold Heath. He stands solidly, outlined against a pale, washed blue sky, his expressionless face turned towards the viewer. This motif shows Crome gaining insight into the significance of simplicity of design and broad spacing, expressed in terms of soft light and chilled air, relying as it does on mass, as distinct from sharp silhouette. The painting is a significant step in the stylistic development of pictorial movement and lighting toward which Crome was making his way. \n     The proposals for dating the picture range from the earlier date of 1812, accepted by both Dickes (p. 76) and Collins Baker (p. 151), to a later one by Binyon (p. 33) of 1815. Clifford (Clifford, 1968, p. 222) believes the painting was executed between \"ca. 1812-15, or even earlier, ca. 1807-8.\" On stylistic grounds it is clear that the Victoria and Albert Museum <i>View on Mousehold Heath</i> was painted at an interval of time close to <i>Norwich from St. Augustine's Gate</i> (plate VII, fig. 56) and <i>The Way through the Woods</i> (fig. 59), and bears no resemblance to earlier brushwork. In each of these paintings the sky reflects the same Cuyp-like characteristics, and similar coloring serves to confirm their relation to the painting in question. The dating of 1812 seems reasonably safe. \n     In the Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design (no., E. 4702-1905) is a print which is connected with the composition of <i>View on Mousehold Heath</i>. It may have been inspired by a Gainsborough drawing or a softground etching in W. F. Wells, <i>A Collection of Prints from the Drawings and Etchings of Thomas Gainsborough, R.A.</i>, ca. 1802. Perhaps the Gainsborough drawing and the present painting were both based on a common original - a Dutch landscape of the 17th century.\"",
