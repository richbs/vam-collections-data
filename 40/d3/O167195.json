            "public_access_description": "This is one of a group of fifteenth or sixteenth-century glazed tiles from the ruins of the city of Gaur, Bengal. Muslim rule was established in Eastern India at the beginning of the thirteenth century after the then Hindu capital of Gaur was captured by Muhammad Bakhtyar Khilji in 1198. The Bengali style of Sultanate architecture developed in the region. Although the style synthesised Muslim influences with characteristics derived from local Hindu and Buddhist architecture, such as the rich use of plant details, glazed tiles were a feature of Muslim origin and indeed one used widely across the Muslim world. Pre-Mughal Islamic building in Bengal often use glazed and unglazed tiles as a decorative feature. The earliest dated appearance of glazed tiles at Gaur is on the Eklakhi tomb, generally accepted as the mausoleum of Sultan Jalal al-Din (d.1431). By the late 15th century the use of tiles had become more widespread, although in Bengal still confined to Muslim buildings. The tiles are in a variety of different shapes.",
