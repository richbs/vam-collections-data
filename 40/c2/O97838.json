            "public_access_description": "The serving of the fashionable hot drinks tea, coffee and chocolate was often the focal point of domestic social rituals in the eighteenth-century. Porcelain tea and coffee sets with matching trays (d\u00e9jeuners) were made for one or two persons to serve themselves in private apartments. The design and elaboration of the decoration of the sets signalled their owner\u2019s taste and wealth. \n\nTea and coffee were not served together at the same time, so the same saucers were often used with both tea and coffee cups. The design of tea cups evolved as the eighteenth century progressed, but tea cups were generally lower and more open in shape than coffee cups. However, it is clear from the records at S\u00e8vres that in France at least certain shapes could be used interchangeably for coffee or tea.\n\nThis is one of a small number of tea and coffee sets very finely decorated with scenes from Goethe's hugely successful novel The Sorrows of Young Werther first published in 1774.  It was made at the Meissen porcelain factory in 1789. All the known services have the same vessel shapes, and certain of the components are painted with the same subjects and scenes. Some of this decoration is after preliminary design drawings by Johann David Schubert (1761-1822), who worked as teacher of drawing at the factory's drawing school from 1786 and who became principal painter at the factory in 1795, and some of Schubert's designs were in turn copied from prints.",

            "bibliography": "M\u00fcller-Scherf, Angelika. Wertherporzellan Petersberg : Michale Imhof Verlag GmbH & Co., 2009 ISBN 9783865684592. This sugar bowl is catalogue no. 7.5a, p. 105. It illustrates an early incident in the novel, described by Werther in his letter dated 15th May. He recounts how much he enjoys chatting to the young women and children who work and play by the village well. One day he arrives at the well and sees a servant girl struggling to place a large water pot on her head. Werther immediately goes to her assistance. The same scene is on the reverse of the Stuttgart teapot, (6.4b, p.92) and on one side of the private collection sugar bowl (8.4b, p.115). The scene on the other side of this sugar bowl, catalogue 7.5b, depicts Werther on a country lane by a river at the moment when he meets a poor deranged man, shabbily dressed. The man tells Werther he is gathering flowers to offer to his princess. This leads Werther to profess his envy for this deluded individual who is happy only because he has lost his mind and mourns man\u2019s destiny that allows a man to be happy only when he is a child, ie before he has acquired reason, or after he has lost his mind. The source is Schubert\u2019s drawing, catalogue 31, p. 141. Compare another scene at the well illustrated on the tray, 1328-1869, exhbition catalogue 7.1.",
