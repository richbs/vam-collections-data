The handle is D-shaped with a central chased rib; at its lower end a separate C-section meets the body and is finished with a shield-shaped plate. Under this is a casting or soldering hole. the thumb-piece is a pair of seeded pomegranates cast and chased rising from entwined cast stems. The raised, slightly domed lid is set onto a right-angled strip fitting inside the rim.\nThe body is engraved with three different flowering plants with roots and pairs of secondary blossoms and buds. The lid is engraved with a stylized cluster of fruit. From this two stems, each with three different flower heads, encircle the central field which is engraved with mantling around a crested helm and coat of arms of Sayer, Kent.

The pegs denote a measure of liquid; after one drinker had drunk their allocated peg measure, the tankard was passed to another. The term 'peg' probably derives from the Danish measure 'paegl', roughly equivalent to a pint. This example contains six pegs. Peg tankards have a long history in the Scandinavian and Baltic countries. British examples are known from Edinburgh, Newcastle upon Tyne, York and Hull, reflecting the established trading links across the North Sea.\n\nDesign & Decoration\nBritish peg tankards usually follow the Scandinavian form, incorporating pomegranate feet and a thumbpiece. The floral engraving  also has parallel examples in Scandinavian silver of the 1650s and later, and is probably based on a volume of botanical illustrations.\n\nMaker\nThis form of peg tankard was a speciality of York goldsmiths. John Plummer, the maker of this example, produced a large number of peg tankards.",
