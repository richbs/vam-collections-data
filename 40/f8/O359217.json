The lining is made from cream silk which is loosely attached between the tips of the ribbing and the supports, and it is then gathered up into six rows of tucking and completely covers the support. The lining projects about 0.5 inch beyond the cover and is doubled back and tacked to the cover. There are ruched bands of silk where the lining and the cover meet the stick. There is a covered button worked in cream silk with a self-coloured double cord and bobble.\n\nThe handle has three silver gilt mounts with a foliated scroll decoration, and two enamel painted portraits of Queen Victoria dated 1837 and 1897. This is a Diamond Jubilee souvenir. There is a large ivory satin ribbon bow tied to the handle.\n\nThe stick is made from wood which appears to be in four interlocking segments just above the handle, but continues in one piece tapering slightly towards the ferule which is made from metal. There are eight metal ribs with copper coloured tips.",
