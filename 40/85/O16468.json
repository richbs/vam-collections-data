            "public_access_description": "Victorian painters and writers were to some degree obsessed with the image of the fallen woman. The antithesis of the virtuous ideal, the prostitute was deemed to have committed the 'greatest sin of all' and such women were outcasts from family and society. Victorian society saw the prostitute as a once-innocent victim, a pure creature seduced and degraded, who must welcome death as her only escape from an insupportable life of guilt and despair. There was pity - in art, if not in life - for these 'soiled doves'. The fate of the prostitute was usually shown to be poverty, disease, and death, a death chosen by the girl herself in preference to her unhappy life. Thomas Hood's poem The Bridge of Sighs (1844) became a classic stereotype of the harlot and her destiny. Dore's illustration to the poem shows the psychologically dramatic moment when the girl chooses suicide; minutes later she will jump from the bridge and drown in the river below.",

Both Hood\u2019s poem and Dickens's ironic letter in which he assumes the character of an old Tory who grumbles about Young England and finds only one thing to be praised, a \u2018Judge who knows how to do his duty\u2019, were provoked by the widely discussed case of Mary Furley. She had been sentenced to death the preceding April for attempting suicide and for drowning one of her illegitimate sons, whom she had clutched to her as she threw herself into the Regent\u2019s Canal in a bid to escape returning to the work-house after her savings had been stolen. For artistic reasons Hood did not mention the child and shifted the scene to Waterloo Bridge, a notorious favourite for suicides. Dickens is said to have been overcome with emotion when he heard Hood\u2019s poem sung.\u2019 '",
