The pink dye is over cream/yellow fibres. The dye is not consistent but is very bright. Some dark brown fibres are included. \nC= a fragment of a maroon fabric. Possibly hemp. Warp and weft are 1-ply with Z twist; approx 16x16 per cm. The dye is over cream fibres and is not totally consistent. Woven with a loose plain weave. One edge has been hemmed with a whip stitch (approx. 11mm wide) using a 2 ply, S twisted thread of the same coloured fibre. Sandy residue present.\nD= Part of flat band of braided goat\u2019s hair. It has three stripes. It is buff in the middle and dark brown on each side. The outer stripes (one braided and one twisted) are of goat\u2019s hair and the inner of plant fibre (possibly hemp). They are sewn together with buff thread (possibly hemp; 2 ply, Z twist) which appears on the outer edges and protrudes from the middle at one end. A piece of blue thread (possibly hemp; 1 ply, Z twist) is attached at one point along the braid but it is uncertain if it belongs with the braid. Sandy residue present.",

Once a military post under the Kingdom of Khotan, Niya became an important oasis along the southern Silk Road. Stein excavated several groups of dwellings there and found hundreds of wedge-shaped wooden tablets, some laced together in pairs with string and affixed with clay seals. The appearance of Pallas Athena, Eros and other Greek deities on some seals showed the impact of western classical art on Khotan. The tablets were inscribed with Kharoshthi, an ancient script of northwest India. Stein identified some as Buddhist prayers and others as administrative documents and he dated them to the period of the Kushan empire, which thrived in the first three centuries AD. Among ruins of dwellings and orchards, Stein found numerous textile fragments, Roman coins, wooden furniture with elaborate carving, pottery, Chinese basketry and lacquer, and documents in Chinese script which he dated to the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD). The V&A holds, on loan, a large number of  textiles from Niya, including leather, wool yarn,  appliqu\u00e9d and stitched wool felt, and braided  animal hair.",
