Already well-established in the artist-groups of Moscow, and her native Kiev, she was thus in an ideal position to inform Russian avant-garde artists about the revolutionary developments of Cubism and Futurism. \n\nCubism was a major influence on Exter's own work of this period. Picasso and Braque had evolved an intellectual analytical mode of representing the visual world: traditional rules of perspective and illusion were abandoned in favour of fragmented forms, depicting an object as it is known to be, rather than as it appears from a single view. One of the chief concerns of Cubism was to represent solidity and volume on a two-dimensional canvas without resorting to the obvious contradictions of an illusory three-dimensional picture space. \n\nThis decorative gouache of c.1914-15 shows how thoroughly Exter had assimilated these principles. The familiar Cubist motif of a musical instrument amid studio paraphernalia on a table-top is presented here as a construction of flat angled planes. She has flattened the forms, but has nevertheless indicated volume and depth by making space a positive element in the composition. The hatched monochrome areas are symbols for the space between and around those coloured planes which make up the still life. The later phase of Cubism was directed by the invention of collage, as a fine art medium, in 1912. Exter herself used collage both in painting and design. This picture shows evidence of the influence of this technique in the simple abstract shapes, and the clear bright colour, which relates closely to certain works by Picasso of 1913-14. \n\nOn her return to Moscow in 1914 Exter applied her painter's training to the theatre, designing sets and costumes for the progressive director Tairov. Russian Modernism found its most complete expression in their dynamic integration of set and costume with actor and gesture. (A number of these advanced abstract designs are in the Department of Prints & Drawings). In 1923 Exter left Russia for Paris, and never returned. \n\nGillian Saunders\"",
