It was then biscuit-fired and painted with oxides of copper (green) and iron or antimony (yellow-brown). The dish was returned to the kiln for the final firing. In order to maximise the space within the kiln, three-point triangular-shaped spurs were used to separate the stacked objects. During this last firing the kiln spur may have fused to the glazed surface and so could not be removed from the dish without damaging it. It was at this time that this dish was discarded as a kiln waster.\n\nThe young man depicted on this fragment is not intended to be a portrait. Italian Renaissance ceramics often bore stylised images of people, more commonly of women. The youth here wears a padded doublet, typical for this period.",
