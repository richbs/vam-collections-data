The masks were traditionally carved from a tree known as the kaduru tree which was believed to have mystical powers. It has soft, light wood,that is easy to carve. After the wood is dried and smoked to help preserve it from insects, the masks are carved with chisels and mallets and painted with a light yellow undercoat before being painted with codified colours to denote the particular features of each character.\n\nAccording to legend Sri Lanka was once ruled by a race known as Rakshasas whose king was Ravana of the Ramayana. Rakshasas could assume various forms, one of which was the cobra. Although there were 24 forms of Rakshasas, only a few features in Kolam dances, and the carving of the head dress on this mask in the form of three cobras identify it as a cobra mask or naga raksha.",
