The implements for display were secured following the cancellation of the Royal Agricultural Society's plans for an independent exhibition in Hyde Park. The inclusion of an agricultural section proved to be important in appealing to a wider audience.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nContemporary descriptions of the wide spectrum of visitors to the Great Exhibition often referred to agricultural workers and farmers, distinguishable by their clothing, even including old men in smocks.  Various observers, including the magazine 'Punch', further noted that it was the workers and the manufacturers who were intently studying the exhibits, such as the latest advances in machinery, while the middle strata of society were more intent on parading the main aisle.  Queen Victoria and Prince Albert however made innumerable visits to the different sections of the Exhibition. Queen Victoria recorded in her diaries how they had particularly enjoyed the explanation of agricultural machinery 'by our agreeable instructor, Mr. Hensman'.",
