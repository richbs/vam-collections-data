It also shows how fifteenth century designs still appealed in the seventeenth century. An early example of this type of cup (now in the Iparm\u00fcv\u00e9szeti Museum, Budapest) dates to 1481; this one in the V&amp;A bears the Nuremberg town assay mark for 1609-21, 140 years later. Cups during this period had a function beyond that of mere drinking vessel. Goldsmiths were often commissioned to make this particular type, known in German as a 'Buckelpokal', or 'lobed cup', as a gift for visiting civic dignitaries or to commemorate family alliances. As this example lacks any inscription or coat of arms, however, the circumstances behind its making are unknown.",

Two possible candidates are recorded in the registers of the Nuremberg goldsmiths company, Paulus Stein and Philipp Scheurer, whose careers overlap with the date of the Nuremberg assay mark on the piece (1609-29).\nThe form of the cup is typical of late-sixteenth and early seventeenth-century Nuremberg goldsmiths' work. The lobed form was extremely popular and these cups were a popular gift among the city \u00e9lite and as gifts to visiting dignitaries. This particular example bears no inscription, however, or arms, so it is impossible to determine whether it was made in response to a particular occasion.",
