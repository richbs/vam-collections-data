In the plan of the ground floor, the Hall & the space of the great stair case, will be better paved with marble or smooth stones: the two round pillars & the two opposite pillasters, which are to support the partition between the said stair case & the dinning room above, may be done in Wood, of any one of the five orders, more sutable to the intended Expence in the building.  The stair case may be done in stone with iron rail, or in the [...?] wainscot, as shall be thought more convenient.  The dimensions of each room are all figured the rest may be found by the scale.  The plan of the 1st floor, up one pair of stairs, is made in two different manners (as to the Back-part of it:) that which is marked A, has a bed-chamber more than the other marked B, but the latter is more grand, & the appartment more compleat.  The objection in the execution of the second manner will be, that the chimney of the dressing room has no true bearing; but a skill full bricklayer may, by the help of a good-sound-hard-stone, of about 4 or 5 foot long, 14 or 15 inches broad, & 7 or 8 inches thick, which may be hidden in the thickness of the floor, secure the jamb of that chimney which will be a two great wheight, because the funel will bear upon the solid wall.  The Partitions between the bedchamber and the dressing room, & between the dressing-room & closet, may be trussed and tak't[?] to the floor up two pairs of stairs; and a skill full carpenter will find no difficulty in gauging the partitions very fast.  The two pair of stairs floor has 4 bedchambers, two light closets and two dark ones.  The elevation marked No 1 is rich and finer than that marked No 2 but the house being a corner house, three fronts must be made alike & therefore except what is left which is made of stone, this better to execute the Elevation No 2 because so much stone work is very expensive.  The roof may be made with garrets in it & a roof of this kind makes the garret rooms almost square & very convenient. but to save expence, the roof may be made flat with an attick story underneath, as in the Elevation No 2: the windows of this story are made square and must be so these rooms being only 10 foot or 11 foot, for the [..?] oft, high and supposed to be only for servants, they will be high enough inside and have on the outside a very good [..?] & a good effect an upright in that manner will save expence considerably.  The coved rustick door in the Elevation No 1 is very good, but if the other elevation is executed, the frontispice that is in it is more suitable to the rest.  This frontispiece done in wood and likewise the Architraves and cornices of the windows, together with the great entablature round the house & Painted in stone colour, will last many years and save a great expence: the great cornice of the house, in such case, must be covered with lead and a blocking course of stone must be layed over it, not only to keep the lead down & to cover the joint, but as a very great ornament to the building.'",
