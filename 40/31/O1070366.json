Full Citation: \n \n\"<b>53 Unknown Man</b> \n<b>c.1650-70</b> \nEvans 358  \n \n<b>Oval 65 x 51 mm</b> \n\nFeatures in very coarse, long brown strokes with some sanguine, bright red hatched into the cheeks, also in long wiry strokes; patches of white imperfectly blended into the forehead and cheeks; red in the lips; small white highlights in the eyes; on a yellowish carnation ground; hair in pale brown wash, lined with darker colour and hatched in pale grey and ochre; collar in a white wash shaded in grey and blue stipples; dress in dark grey wash modelled in pale grey; background a pale grey opaque wash, lightening almost transparently to the right; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table- book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Evidently most of the present surface at the head and the background is repainted.  \n \n<b>Signed:</b> Spuriously in gold, lower centre right: <i>DDG</i> the <i>G</i> truncated.  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Probably nineteenth-century silver-gilt, composite oval locket consisting of a convex plain back set in strip sides of complex section, into the front of which is fitted a narrow removable bezel set with a convex glass. The hanger is of two pieces of wire soldered at the loop and separating outward into gradually tapering spirals of fourteen turns. The back is engraved in a modern copperplate: <i>David.Des.Granges</i>.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Included with the other objects in the Alan Evans Collection and assumed to have been bequeathed by him to the National Gallery, 1974; placed with the rest of the Collection on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.)  \n \nThe miniature is supernumerary to the main Wallop- Evans Collection. It was not lent to the V&A 1927-49 and was not included in Christie's insurance valuation of the Collection in 1969. \n\nClearly a seventeenth-century object in origin, it is now too damaged and restored for much to be gleaned from the remaining stylistic evidence. The overall impression, however, is of Des Granges, and the present signature may be a repainted version of one lost in the smartening- up of the background.\"",
