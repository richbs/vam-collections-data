Born into a Jewish family in Frankfurt, she initially pursued an academic career before moving to Paris in 1930 to concentrate on photography.\n\nThis photograph was taken during a trip to New York in 1936 organised by the author Hendrik Willem Van Loon, who supported Bing and hints at the influence of photographer Alfred Stieglitz, who she met on this trip. Bing was skilled in photojournalism and developed a distinctive response to New York. Focusing on the timelessness in everyday images, she looked for modernist steep perspectives and cropped details. Here, Bing captures a man striding across the road, framed by a comparatively huge lamp-post against the background of the solid, modern buildings.",
