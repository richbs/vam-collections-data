The front plates are repousse and chased with scrollwork, foliage and fruit involving half length figures of the Four Evangelists with their symbols, and three bearded heads. Nailed to the front is a raised and chased figure of Christ. The rear plates are chased and repousse with fruit and foliage, a bird, half length figures of angels holding the symbols of the Passion and four strapwork frames containing busts, two in classical armour, two in mid- sixteenth century costume. Applied in the centre is the cast and chased figure of the crowned Virgin standing on a crescent supported by a cherub's head, and surrounded by six flying angels. The lower end of the cross fits in to an oblong socket on top of the large knop of flattened globular shape. This last is writhen, partly engraved with hatched tracery and encircled by six lozenge- shaped bosses each containing a cast and a chased head. Tapering socket of circular section embossed with a quatrefoil; there is a flange at the bottom.",

A cross was often put on the altar during the Mass, but crosses were also carried in procession before a service, and on ceremonial occasions such as funerals. In early times, people held them in their hand, but later they raised them high on poles. \n\nFrom its size and knop (the protrusion on the stem) this is clearly a processional cross.  The decoration on the front includes the heads of Sts Peter and Paul and the symbols of the Evangelists \u2013 the eagle of St John, the ox of St Luke, the angel of St Matthew and the lion of St Mark. The Virgin of the Assumption is depicted on the back.",

Models of the cross begin to appear from about 350 AD, probably for use in private prayer. Only from about 1000 was a cross regularly placed on the altar during Mass; a more ancient custom was to suspend a cross above the altar or to place one beside it. Crosses were also carried in procession before a service. In early centuries these were hand-held, later replaced by more visible crosses raised on staffs.\n\nBoth ltar and processional crosses were generally made of precious or gilt metal, or ivory, and decorated with gems. From about 800 they were adorned with the image of the crucified Christ and became known as crucifixes. By about 1100 the iconography of European crosses had become established, usually including the symbols of the four Evangelists, often with the Virgin Mary and St John the Evangelist flanking the figure of Christ crucified.",
