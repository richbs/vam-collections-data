Most had a loop on the back for attachment, but in Norway and Sweden stud buttons were also used.  These were mainly worn by men, at the throat, to keep their shirts closed.  They were often decorated with filigree.  \n\nThe pattern on this stud button, of applied circles of twisted wire, probably dates back to the late Middle Ages, when it was found on spherical buttons all over Europe.  By the 19th century they survived only in the north, in Scandinavia and Russia.  This button was made in Ystad, in Sk\u00e5ne, in the extreme south of Sweden.  Sk\u00e5ne province has the richest tradition of jewellery, and more was worn there than in any other district.  Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.",
