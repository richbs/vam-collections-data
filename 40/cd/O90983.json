A survey of life in Suffolk and Norfolk, the book combined written accounts of his travels with images of rural scenes. Emerson published a portfolio of photographs from this series in 1890. In an accompanying text he explained how they illustrated his theory that photographers should use selective, or 'differential', focus to record the effects of nature. The result--as you can see here in his treatment of the wispy hay on the cart--might be considered a photographic equivalent of Impressionist painting. Of this image he remarked 'it is not perfectly \"sharp\" in any part and the hay-carts in the distance are as sharp as they should be'.",
