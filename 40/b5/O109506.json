In 18th-century London, leading citizens founded institutions to assist the poor, sick and isolated. Prevention was better than a cure, and in 1758 the Asylum for Female Orphans was founded to prevent prostitution. In the same year the Magdalen Hospital was established to reform repentant prostitutes.\n\nHospital governors recognised the importance of religion in educating and nurturing those for whom they cared. Regular communion was considered part of the healing process. In poorhouses parish officers saw that communion was celebrated and prayer books distributed.\n\nThe Foundling Hospital was founded by Captain Thomas Coram in 1746 to provide a home and education for orphans and abandoned babies. The Hospital Governors wanted the children to be 'early instructed in the Principles of Religion and Morality'. They erected a Chapel adjoining the Hospital in Lamb's Conduit Fields as there was no place of public worship to which the Children and Servants of the Hospital could conveniently resort. The Governors resolved that thechildren 'do constantly attend Divine Service in the Chapel on Sundays & that the officers of the Hospital do often remind them of the lowness of their Condition, that they may early imbibe the Principles of Humility and Gratitude to their Benefactors'. The chapel opened in 1753 with a special performance of music by the composer George Frederick Handel.",
