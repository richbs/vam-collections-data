There is a border with a green meander, leaves and a red or blue trefoil flower.  This also forms the 3 sides of the central rectangular panel. The main border is on three sides.  The ground is quilted in a diamond pattern with what looks like yellow silk.  There is a fine green meander through elongated light or dark leaves with pink and red pointed flowers and smaller blue and pale-coloured pointed flowers.\nThe central panel is divided into a lobed niche by a decorative band worked in a chevron pattern.  The spandrels are not quilted but are divided into a diamond lattice by small red and white diamonds each with 2 pairs of small serrated leaves.  Each diamond contains a small red or pale bud - the colours alternate in bands.\nThe ground of the niche is quilted in a scale pattern with green silk.  There are offset bands in which a pointed pink flower, buds and a left-curving stem alternating with a small almost circular carnation.  One of these carnations is either side of a roundel in the upper part of the niche.  Above it are 3 small pointed flowers.  The roundel contains an inscription and the date 1226 AH. [1811AD]. \nThere is an almost identical prayer mat in the collection (1410-1900) with a slightly different border and the same date; they may be from the same workshop.",
