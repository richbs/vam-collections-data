This piece wwas one that was considered for the collages of photocopies that formed the floor piece of the installation.  Helen Chadwick had begun to use a photocopier after becoming frustrated by having to use an assistant in order to photograph her own body.  The photocopying process offered her a very direct way of realising the images of her own body and the subjects represented in Of Mutability.  Chadwick had used the a range of dead animals in the installation and used the scanner of the photocopier to position the animals in animated poses as if in life.  She used a blue pigment toner in this work to suggest other physical spaces such as the sea.",
