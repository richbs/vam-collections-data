Designed for a scene featuring McLaren dancing in Highgate Cemetery, Reid has insisted that the concept was 'hugely humanitarian', the point being that there is some good in everyone.\nJack the Ripper was an unidentified Victorian serial killer of prostitutes, active in the Whitechapel area of London in late 1888. The name originated in a letter sent to the London Central News Agency by someone claiming to be the murderer. He remains famous as the murders were widely covered by newspapers, whose circulation was growing rapidly around this time.\nJamie Reid's cut-and-paste aesthetic, as seen on this artwork, developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, who would later become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
