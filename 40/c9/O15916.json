He was also a keen teacher and journalist, and published instruction books on pattern-making and articles on the decorative arts and contemporary designers and manufacturers. He designed lace and embroidery, as well as producing designs for the more commercial techniques of furnishing and carpet manufacture, weaving and printing. In 1881 he became artistic director of Turnbull and Stockdale, a newly founded firm of printers in Lancashire.\nThis fabric was probably manufactured by Thomas Wardle & Co, Staffordshire. Wardle entered his father\u2019s business as a silk dyer. He was an avid traveller and his textiles show his interest in Indian and Middle Eastern patterns. He was recognised as an expert in the field of textile dyeing, in particular, and advised the British government on the Cyprus silk industry and the Indian government on silk making in Kashmir. In 1897 he was knighted for his services to the silk industry.\n\nWardle sold his textiles through a number of London shops, from the artistic (Liberty) to the more general (Debenham & Freebody). Between 1883 and 1888 his own shop, Wardle & Co., traded in New Bond Street.",
