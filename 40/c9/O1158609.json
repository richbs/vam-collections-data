            "public_access_description": "This object is one of a collection given to the museum.  The collection is quite important as it belonged to Dennis Arkinstall.  Dennis worked in the toy industry for a company called Lines Brothers Ltd, they were mostly famous for their Tri-ang range of toys.  Dennis was a sculptor and worked in the research and development of new toys for the company in particular the dolls which were produced under the Pedigree trade name.  The catalogues highlight that their range of dolls are realistic and produced by a sculptor.   We do not know when Dennis started working at the factory but we know that he was an influential figure in the designing of their most popular doll Sindy, which was produced in 1963.  \n\nThis collected includes dolls from other manufactures as he would have collected them to inspire new ideas.  They are often just heads, which was not uncommon as these were usually exported in large numbers and the bodies made at their destination as it was a cheap way to manufacture.  The collection also includes moulds and experimental pieces from the factory as well as complete ones in their presentation boxes.\n\nThis doll is not Tri-ang made unlike the rest of the collection given to the museum by Dennis Arkinstalls' son. It is made by the American company Aranbee which began producing dolls in 1922 in New York. Aranbee originally imported and made dolls and dolls' parts. In 1929 they gained a US patent for joining the head and the arms of dolls together and they made bisque, composition, rubber, hard plastic and vinyl dolls. They continued to manufacture dolls until 1961, although from 1951 they were brought by Vogue dolls.\n\nThis particular doll is from the 1930s Storybook dolls made by Aranbee that were all composition and either had moulded hair or a wig and wore the appropriate costume for their character. 'Mary had a little lamb' is just one of the dolls they produced alongside examples such as Bo Peep, Snow White amd Jack & Jill.",
