He is one of the twelve Adityas, presides over the 6th month of the year and is also the guardian of the SW quarter. The sun deity is represented standing erect, holding lotus blossoms in his raised hands. The high boots and short sword are a legacy of his Iranian ancestry.  He wears a high faceted headdress decorated in a trellis of diamond-shaped quatrefoils. He wears elaborate earrings which dangle on his shoulders below flaring streamers. He is richly be-jewelled over a diaphanous robe which falls full-length to his feet. At his feet is depicted  his  half-brother, the  charioteer Aruna (the Morn). On the proper right, stand  the god Pingala with pen and ink-bottle (broken away) and the goddess Nikshuta (Earth). On the left  is the god Dandanayaka holding  a staff (danda) and the goddess Rajni (\"Air\"). At the god's feet is his principal consort Prabha (\"brightness\"). Above the attendant divinities are the female archers Usha and Pratyusha driving off the hosts of night. At  each top corner appears a celestial singer (Gandharva) in a cloud, bearing a garland. In the lower register are the seven horses and Surya's chariot, represented by the spoked wheel.\nThe figures are carved in high relief against a flat rhomboid-shaped back slab with curved angles at the optics is decorated with a border of abstract floral motifs on a criss-crossed ground.  The stele has a stone tenon in the centre of the base for slotting into its original architectural setting.",

All the horses face left, a unique configuration.\n\nThe cult of Surya maintained a key position in the hierarchy of deities into the medieval period.  Although usurped by Visnu and his solar aspects, Surya nonetheless \nmaintained his position as a major, if secondary, deity. Major temples were dedicated to Surya across India, as witnessed by Konarak in Orissa, and Modera in Gujarat. This sculpture, of unrecorded origin, undoubtedly graced a temple of some importance in Bihar, eastern India.",

ISBN 9788476649466\nThe Sun God Surya\nEastern India/ 10th century\nBlack basalt/ 143.5cm\n\nConventionally the deity wears a crown and long boots, and holds a lotus in each hand. According to tradition he rides across the sky in a horse-drawn chariot; this is suggested by a wheel at the bottom right hand corner and a row of seven horses. Within the lotus-decorated frame are, above an 'apsaras' in each corner, Usha and Pratyusha with bows, four standing deities and on smaller scale in the middle the figures of Aruna and Pritivi.\nSee Kramrisch [1929] frontpiece.\nLippincott, Kristen, with Umberto Eco, E.H.
