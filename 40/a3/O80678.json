An imaginative rather than a literal description of the scene, partly inspired by the description of the Serpent towering erect in Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>, IX, 496-500 and 670-7. Raine suggests that Blake introduced the waterfall behind because of Porphyry's association of flowing water with generation, this embodiment of the material forming part of Blake's idea of the Fall. Restored by Dr. Hell 1953-4 and now under treatment again. \n   Rossetti also lists as the next item (1863, no. 108; 1880, no. 131) 'The Temptation', a tempera, as 'From Mr.Butts', which is perhaps a duplication of this work. Its position in his lists (the next item is 'The Almighty accusing Eve') suggests that he thought it was a temptation of Eve, and his ignorance of its actual ownership that he may not have seen it.
