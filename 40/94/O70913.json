She was just 17 when she  made this print. The image looks almost like a sheet of studies and illustrates a scene of interrogation from the novel Crime and Punishment by Fydor Dostoyevsky. In spite of her youth, Hamerschlag seems keenly aware of the writer's  intense psychological insight into deranged morality.",
