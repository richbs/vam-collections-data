The 'Recording Britain' project started in 1939 with the purpose of recording aspects of British landscape that might be destroyed and lost under enemy bombing, known as Baedeker raids because they targeted Britain's most beautiful cities. It was Ginger's skill as a topographical artist that led to her first commission as an artist, a watercolour of Chelsea Bridge, which was presented as a gift to the Canadian Prime Minister when he officially opened it in 1937. Ginger was also given permission to sketch the bombed streets of London. Another topographical related project that Ginger became involved in was the Schools Prints scheme. Set up in 1945 by Brenda Rawnsley, the scheme commissioned well-known artists to create lithographs that would then be printed in large numbers and sold cheaply to schools for display in classrooms. Subjects usually (though not exclusively) represented British life and landscape and Ginger, who lived near Bath at the time, chose Bristol Town Centre as her subject.",
