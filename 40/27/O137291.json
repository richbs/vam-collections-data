            "public_access_description": "The bow tie originated among Croatian mercenaries during the Prussian wars of the 17th century, wherein the Croats used a scarf around the neck to hold together the opening of their shirts. This method was soon adopted, under the name Cravat, by the upper classes in France and flourished in the 18th and 19th centuries. It is uncertain whether the cravat then developed into the bow tie and necktie, or if the cravat gave rise to the bow tie, which in turn lead to the necktie. Although the necktie is favoured in today's society, the bow tie is making a comeback with fun-formal events such as dinner and cocktail parties. It is still also much more common to wear a bow tie with a dinner jacket than it is to wear a necktie with one; previously the bow tie was the only proper neckwear for a tuxedo.\n\nThis object was given to the museum by Sir Roy Strong. An author, broadcaster, former Director of the National Portrait Gallery and from 1974-1987, Director and Secretary of the Victoria & Albert Museum; Sir Roy was a high-profile figure renowned for his sartorial flair. The bow tie was part of an ensemble which included a two-piece lightweight brown wool suit with a fine white woven fleck, designed by John Michael, a pair of brown leather Moreschi shoes and a white cotton Turnbull and Asser shirt.",
