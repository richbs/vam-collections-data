The strips were assembled to form a single art work, showing the subtle variations of the flowers over time. The choice of subject was inspired by a photograph of nasturtiums by the French photographer Eug\u00e8ne Atget (1857\u20131927) and the oil painting Nasturtiums (1880) by Henri Fantin-Latour (1836\u20131904), which is in the V&A collection (Museum no. S.EX.24-1884). The uniqueness of the collage is in stark contrast to the mass-production technology used to create it.",
