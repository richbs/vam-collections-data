He had been living in Srinagar as Director of the Technical Institute of Kashmir, and wrote to the museum in 1922 offering to sell his collection before he left that year to return to the UK. The tiles are said to have come from the tomb of Madani near But Kadal in Srinagar, Kashmir.  The building dates from the mid-fifteenth century, but was refurbished by a Mughal nobleman in Shah Jahan\u2019s reign (1628-1658). The tiles were possibly  made in Lahore.",

He had been living in Srinagar as Director of the Technical Institute of Kashmir, and wrote to the museum in 1922 offering to sell his collection before he left that year to return to the UK. The tiles are said to have come from the tomb of Madani near But Kadal in Srinagar, Kashmir.  The building dates from the mid-fifteenth century, but it was refurbished by a Mughal nobleman in Shah Jahan\u2019s time. The tiles probably were made in Lahore.",
