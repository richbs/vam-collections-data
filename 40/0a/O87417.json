Her family was of German descent, and she studied art in D\u00fcsseldorf from 1906-1908, remaining in Germany until just before her marriage in 1915 to Enrico Scavini, who eventually became her business partner.  Elena and her brother started a doll-making venture  to supplement her income while her husband was away fighting during World War I.  The felt which has always been their most characteristic material was evidently readily available, even during the war, probably thanks to Turin's cloth-producing industry.  In 1919, the name Lenci was finally registered as a trademark by Enrico Scavini, and the letters were also said to have been used by the company to spell out the motto \"Ludus Est Nobis Constanter Industria\" (Play is Our Constant Work), though it should probably be 'ludus est noster constanter industria'.",
