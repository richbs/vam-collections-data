Apart from the base which has a simple cut lattice design, all the faces display a mix of stylised flowers, scrolling leaves and berries. The top of the lid has two pairs of male and female figures, presumably lovers, standing under a tree. The front, back and sides each have a pair of figures, apparently male and female, sitting (female) and kneeling (male). There are traces of red and white paint.\n\nBrassy metal mounts, fixed with brassy pins\nThe lid is attached with three long hinges that run right around the casket. They have an applied rosette on the lid and triple bands near the hinges. Two terminate in fleur-de-lis, while the central one ends in the lock and its hasp. These hinges are of rounded profile on the lid and back, but flattened at the hinge point and underneath. A similar band runs along the bottom of the casket, from side to side, terminating on each side. Plain, rounded bands protect the arrises of the lid. Around the edge of the lid and the corners of the casket are nailed flat bands hatched with a regular bead pattern, and inscribed along the front of the lid in gothic letters LEAUTE DORT (?). The lock engraved with a gothic letter, possibly b. The loop handle of hexagonal profile.\n\nThe interior not seen.",

Beechwood covered with boiled leather, still brown in colour, with tooled decoration, partly in relief, surmounted brass hinges and other brass mounts.\n\nBox of rectangular plan (ichnography).  Lid in the form of a frustum [ie what is left when the top is sliced off square] of a rectangular pyramid.  \n\nThree band hinges of brass, the upper members travelling forward, as shaped sides bearing rosettes and terminating on the front slope in fleur-de-lys (lateral), and in the lock-hasp (centre); the lower members travelling, backwards and beneath and terminating on the front in fleur-de-lys (lateral) and the lock (centre).  Lid edged with brass banding, chased on the front with the legend LEAVTE DORT, in Gothic letter, of uncertain allusion.  On the back, the Gothic letter V, perhaps for a numeral.  Underneath, a crossband terminating at either end in a fleur-de-lys.  Loop handle of brass.\n\nIn the lateral panels of the top, at the ends, on the front and at the back, are pairs of figures beneath trees and other scenes in the convention of courtly love (l'amour courteois)  \n\nInterior never leather - covered nor lined.  \n\nNORTHERN FRENCH; about 1400\n\nNotes by W.A.Thorpe c1959:\nW.97-1910\n\nGeneral remarks\n\nInscribed for sale to \u201cfraternizing\u201d prisoners-of war ??
