His workshops excelled in creating the rich embroideries which typify the designer's work. The pearl and silver embroidery bordering the deep V-neck of the dress is reflected in the sweeping band of embroidery on the skirt.  To retain the line, the skirt is lined with buckram and weighted around the hem. Further support is provided by a stiffened petticoat.\n\nWedding dresses were often altered to become evening wear but fortunately this design survived intact. It was worn by Hermione Wills when she married Mervin Evans on 23 July 1951. The bride's mother, Mrs. Cecil Wills, was a good friend of Hartnell, and later became one of the directors of his fashion house.",

Her mother, Mrs Cecil Wills was an early friend and later a director of Norman Hartnell.\n\nThe dress was specially designed by Hartnell for the bride. The embroidery and decoration on the front of the dress includes a bare spot of fabric between the bands of ornament on the neckline and skirt. This was designed specifically for a diamond brooch which is visible in the wedding photographs. When worn, the brooch connected the sweeping bands of embroidery and created an unbroken curve of sparkling ornamentation around the neckline and skirt.\n\nHermione Wills met Merfyn Evans during a round-the-world voyage. He was the chief officer of a cargo boat called The Javanese Prince, and she was a paying passenger. They became engaged within 48 hours of their meeting. Sadly, Merfyn died a few years after the wedding. His widow remarried an Army man, Mr. Ball, and they lived in Malaysia. She wore a deep blue lace, long-sleeved, mid-calf length cocktail dress (also by Norman Hartnell) for the second wedding with a matching coat. The going-away costume, by Hartnell, was cafe-au-lait silk woven with velvet wavy-lines, with a darker cafe-au-lait coat.",
