The subject  was a favourite theme in tapestries, particularly in the15th and 16th century.  Both Henry VIII and his Lord Chancellor, Cardinal Wolsey, owned Esther tapestries and several sets are listed in the numerous entries for tapestries in the inventory of Henry VIII's possessions.\n\nEsther was the wife of  the King of Persia. The King allowed his chief minister to order the massacre of all Jews in the Persian empire. Esther, who was Jewish, risked her own death by approaching the King unbidden, to intercede with him to save her people. In this scene Ahasuerus is shown seated on a throne under a canopy, extending his sceptre to Esther kneeling before him, to indicate his approval of her request.",
