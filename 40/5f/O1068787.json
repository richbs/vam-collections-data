These included Buck Shooting in Windsor Great Park (Tate, no.4822; exhibited Royal Academy 1826; British Institution 1827) and portraits of individual sportsmen and their dogs.  This watercolour may be a work in its own right or it may be a study for an unknown composition.  Lewis exhibited two watercolours that included foxes at the Society of Painters in Water Colours: \u2018Wild Ducks surprised by a Fox\u2019 (1829) and \u2018Fox and Duck\u2019 (1831) (location of both unknown), but he is not known to have depicted the foxhunt itself.",
