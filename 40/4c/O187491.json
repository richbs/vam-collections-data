On 12 April 1871, the Commune authorized its destruction, which was carried out with great celebrations on 16 May.\n\nAfter the war Courbet, who was elected to the Commune at the April by-elections, was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and ordered to pay an enormous fine towards the column's reconstruction. To avoid finding the sum he fled to Switzerland.",
