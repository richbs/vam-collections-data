Read, RDI, ARCA, FSIA studied metalwork at the Royal College of Art 1919-1923.  His interest in Gropius's work led him to visit the Bauhaus.  After working with the French lighting firm of Bagn\u00e9s, 1924-25, he became consultant designer and director of Troughton and Young, where he gained a reputation as a pioneer in the design of light fittings.  He was also later retained as a designer by the Carter, Stabler and Adams Ltd (Poole Pottery). Working with many architects of the Modern Movement in the 1920s and 1930s, he did much to alter the character of interior lighting.",
