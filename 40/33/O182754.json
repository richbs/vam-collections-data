Illustrated fig. 26. The Meissen prototype for this model is fig. 25 and examples in salt-glazed and Whieldon-type earthenwares, and Liverpool (Gilbody) porcelain are figs. 27-29.\nErrol Manners states that this Longton Hall figure appears in different ceramic bodies made in Staffordshire, but was not made at Chelsea or Bow.  '..presumably there was some close relationship between the factories producing these wares which is not properly understood today.  Surprisingly the same model of the 'Persian' is also found in Gilbody's porelain from Liverpool.  It seems that the Gilbody figure copies the Meissen directly rather than the Longton Hall version.  Given the rarity of this Meissen figure it is surprising to see it so widely copied but perhaps one single figure was responsible for all the copies.'",
