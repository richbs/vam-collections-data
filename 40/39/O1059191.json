Features in elongated hatches, tending diagonally in the forehead, of brown and sanguine with blue, blended with some white heightening on a pale carnation ground; hair in brown wash, lined with darker colour and heightened with pale grey; collar in grey, modelled in white and darker grey; tie in black modelled with grey; armour in brown wash, hatched with dark brown and grey and heightened with pale grey and white; the studs in brown with highlights in gold; background an opaque dark grey-brown wash to the left, and to the right a sky with suggestion of landscape in opaque blue and grey washes; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table- book. \n\n<u>Frame:</u> Possibly early nineteenth-century silver locket, with convex back, the sides with a double narrow channel flaring out to the bezel, which holds the convex glass by its bevelled edge; the hanger a large hoop of wire of triangular section. At the front its footing is masked by the two flat curved ends of the diminishing spirals of five turns.

Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>122 Unknown Man</b> \n<b>c.1663</b>\nP108-1910 \n\n<b>Oval 67 x 52.5 mm</b> \n\nFeatures in elongated hatches, tending diagonally in the forehead, of brown and sanguine with blue, blended with some white heightening on a pale carnation ground; hair in brown wash, lined with darker colour and heightened with pale grey; collar in grey, modelled in white and darker grey; tie in black modelled with grey; armour in brown wash, hatched with dark brown and grey and heightened with pale grey and white; the studs in brown with highlights in gold; background an opaque dark grey-brown wash to the left, and to the right a sky with suggestion of landscape in opaque blue and grey washes; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table- book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Some rubs and polishes on the surface; otherwise fine. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Centre left, in gold: <i>TF</i> (see E in Appendix 2). \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Possibly early nineteenth-century silver locket, with convex back, the sides with a double narrow channel flaring out to the bezel, which holds the convex glass by its bevelled edge; the hanger a large hoop of wire of triangular section. At the front its footing is masked by the two flat curved ends of the diminishing spirals of five turns. A printed label of South Kensington 1867 inscribed: <i>On loan from/Mr Reynolds/March 1867</i>. Inscribed on another label in ink: <i>Capn. J.H. Reynolds/ Grenadier Guards/ 66Victoria Street/London SW</i>. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> In 1865, C W Reynolds, by descent to J H Reynolds; acquired probably indirectly by George Salting (1) and by him bequeathed to the Museum, 1910. \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> South Kensington 1865, no. 669 (as the Duke of Ormonde); presumably also ex-catalogue of the National Portraits exhibition at South Kensington in 1867. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Salting Collection, 1911, p. 46 (as one of the Salting group); Foster 1911, pp. 548-9; Foster 1914-16, vol. n. p. 110, no. 36; Long 1929, p. 155; Long 1930, p. 28; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 21. \n\nSalting evidently did not question the identification of this miniature as the Duke of Ormonde (1610-1688) and Foster, in his <i>Athenaeum</i> review of the Salting Collection,  (2) was the first to express doubts publicly. Long felt there could be no doubt at all, and from the beginning labelled the miniature in the Museum as <i>A Gentleman</i>. \nOn costume the portrait should date from c.1663, which places it fairly early in Flatman's oeuvre. Stylistically it shows how remote in technique and the details of handling Flatman could be from Cooper at this date. The hatching in the face, which creates the relief and marks the features, is exceptionally systematic and grid-like, and it recalls the lessons in drawing curved forms illustrated by engravings in the handbooks of the graphic arts, such as that by Faithorne, Flatman's friend and probable mentor, the <i>Art of Graveing and Etching</i> of 1662.
