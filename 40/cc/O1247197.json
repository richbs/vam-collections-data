Mrs Stratton whose London premises were located at 104, Piccadilly, was commissioned to make the Princess's bridal dress and several other garments for her trousseau. This was a very prestigious commission which confirmed her position as one of London's leading court dressmakers.\n\nPrincess Beatrice (1857-1944) was Queen Victoria's youngest daughter. She married Prince Henry of Battenberg (1858-1896)  on 23 July 1885 at Whippingham Church, Osborne, in the Isle of Wight.",

Princess Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore (1857-1944), the youngest daughter of Queen Victoria, who married Prince Henry of Battenberg (1858-1896) on 23 July 1885 at Whippingham Church, Osborne, Isle of Wight. The cuttings were preserved, and presumably taken, by Mrs Caroline Augusta Gammack (1852-1916) who worked as a stock keeper for Mrs Stratton. \n\nThese fabrics were used to make a gown. <i>The Graphic</i>, 'The Princess Beatrice's Trousseau', 27 July 1885, included this description. 'In anticipation of chill autumn was a ruby velvet gown, with a long plan train, the front elaborately embroidered in a conventional design, carried out in ruby coloured beads; bodice draped with velvet, and embroidered to match the <i>tablier</i>; the short sleeves slit up to the shoulder, a style so becoming to a well-shaped arm.'",
