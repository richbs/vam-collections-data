It was originally produced at The Standard Theatre in Shoreditch High Street in October 1898, and revived the following Easter. There was a fashion for action-packed melodramas in the late 1890s and early 1900s, their popularity enhanced by the advances in stage design, lighting and stage effects. Posters illustrating the scenic delights of melodramas were eye-catching and successful in making people want to see the action for themselves.\n\nMelodrama went down especially well at The Standard Theatre owned by Andrew Melville or Andrew Melville Robbins (1853-1896), who by 1894 also owned The Grand Theatre Birmingham and The New Theatre Swansea.  His wife Alice ran The Standard after his death until 1904 when it was taken over by their sons Walter  (b.1875) and Frederick (b.1877), who with their younger brother Andrew (b.1882) also became well-known for their productions of spectacular melodramas and pantomimes, some of which were written by them.",
