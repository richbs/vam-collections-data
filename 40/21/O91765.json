It seems unlikely that this forms part of the original design since Viglius d'Ayta appears to have no connection with Spain although he did serve in the Duke of Alba's civil service in the Low Countries.\nKinkier where Ruiz worked was quite unimportant as a centre of goldsmithing in Gothic times but rose to prominence during the 16 century through the prosperity of the Castillian wool trade. Ruiz along with the three members of the Basal family was one of the most distinguished protagonists in this development.\nHildburgh bought from Victor Rothschild Collection, Sotheby\u2019s 26-28 April, 1937, lot 153.",
