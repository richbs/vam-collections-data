These were the precursors to larger works - paintings and prints - which were made up of two or more parts, creating a kind of large-scale comic strip. As a feminist, she took her subjects from the apparently trivial details of everyday life.\n\nThis print, which is a diptych made up of two images on separate sheets, has the bold painterly graphic style of her paintings. By using two near identical images, of differing scales, she also suggests analogies with film and animation, and she has since worked in these media. She has said \"I use a lot of repetition. And the repetition becomes a filmic way of talking because as you put one image after the other, even though it\u2019s the exact identical image, everyone sees something changing from one image to the next.\"",
