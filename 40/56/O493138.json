Made of wheel-turned stoneware clay, the turning marks visible on body and foot; impurities in the body have come out in the firing. Most of the pot is unglazed, and has fired grey with attractive red-brown patches of oxidation. An abstract pattern of incised lines on the shoulder, and an abstract pattern reserved in the blue glaze that covers the shoulder area. The inside of the mouth glazed red. Both glazes are high-firing, and the total effect was probably achieved in one firing. Above the foot are impressed two potter's seals.",

The firm consists of three potters, a father and two sons. The father, Ceng Leng, is in his seventies and was famous in the 1950s for his animal figurines, made for state-controlled kilns. He is now [1991] consultant to the firm. His two sons, Ceng Li (born 1950) and Ceng Peng (born 1953) work as potters, together with Liang Peixing (born 1954) an expert in certain glazes. They still use wood-operated kilns.\n\nBiographies of the potters, plus a signed Certificate of Authenticity with seals, are on the RPs.",
