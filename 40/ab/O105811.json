It was considered to be both nutritious and a healthy alternative to the dubious quality of the water. The use of cheaper Sheffield plate for this ticket shows the wide market for bottle tickets at many levels of society.\n\nThe history of bottle tickets provides a fascinating insight into English eating, drinking and personal habits.  Contemporary gazettes begin to refer to \u2018labels for bottles\u2019 in the 1770s but it was not until the 1790s that they were established as wine or decanter labels.  Their function was to identify the contents of a bottle or decanter, which might alternatively contain spirits, sauces, toilet waters or cordials.  These tickets also illustrate in miniature, the skills of the silversmith over the last two hundred years.  While the variety of styles and materials were enormous, silver bottle tickets tended to reflect fashionable designs in metalware generally.  Makers were quick to adapt the many technical advances of the period 1700-1900  to the manufacture of bottle tickets.",
