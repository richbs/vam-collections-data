The linear treatment of the figures is emblematical of his vigorous style, and reminiscent of his caricatures for the satirical journal <i>Le Charivari</i>. \n\nThe drawing on the recto is typical of the many sketches datable from the 1860s showing lawyers passing, waving to each other and walking together (Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts de Reims; Williamstown, Sterling and Francine Clark Institute).This sketch is almost similar to the composition on the reverse of the watercolour <i>Le boucher, march\u00e9 Montmartre</i>.\n\nThe drawing on the verso can be on the other hand related to a series of sketches focusing in the foreground on a lawyer pleading (see for instance <i>Le Defenseur</i>, Washington, the Phillips Collection). Moreover the gesture of this figure with his arms stretched recall another sketch in the V&A collection entitled <i>Une cause criminelle (L\u2019information</i> [CAI. 125], which is most likely a preparatory study for the watercolour of the same title and dated about 1865 (The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles).\n\nDaumier was a prolific draughtsman hence the difficulty to date most of his sketches. However these often turn out to be preparatory studies for compositions later engraved. It is not rare to find stylistic discrepancies in Daumier\u2019s work of the same period: this would explain that although the drawing on the recto with many apparent pentimenti seems different than the one on the verso much more confident, they can be both dated of the same time. \n\nDaumier was most celebrated during his life time for his satirical and anti-monarchist illustrations rather than his paintings and drawings. This sheet is a good example of Daumier\u2019s observation of the French society and its professional categories. He did a few series of sketches focusing on different categories such as musicians, comedians, art collectors, rustic life, saltimbanques\u2026",
