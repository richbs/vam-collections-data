It fastens down the centre front with matching wound silk domed buttons. The narrow ribbon stripe headed by a brown and green braid, which is fringed at one side and has a zig zag edge to the other, is banded at the other edge by a brown bobble fringe and is used to trim the bodice. It borders the opening of the sleeve, the epaulet and the pointed yoke. The white cotton scalloped collar which is tacked on at the neck has a floral openwork design. The closed gathered cuff, which is attached to an inner sleeve, has an openwork design in graduated holes. The bodice is lined in white cotton and is boned at the side seams. There is a tape waist-band with two round section brass hooks and eyes.\n[Skirt] Skirt gathered onto a wide waistband which becomes wider at the centre front and does up at the centre back, where it fastens with two hooks and eyes. It is flat pleated in the front and tightly gauged at the centre back. There is a wide ribbon-striped flounce at the hips and another at the hem. The lining is of white cotton and stitched inside the lower flounce line is a series of white cotton tapes with a punched white metal eyelet. At the hem is a brown ribbon skirt guard. There is a black silk pocket inside the left hip.",
