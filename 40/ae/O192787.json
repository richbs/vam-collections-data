Printing was by Robert Dansby, Richard Hammond, and Francisco Siqueiros at Cirrus Editions in Los Angeles. The prints are  appropriated from cinema footage. The title may be a  reference to John Garfield's film The Fallen Angel  (c.1950). The central panel shows a hand-held gun. This points at a picture at the right of three men, each of  the faces obscured by a screen-printed circle of  primary colour. Below them is a leaping fish. At left  is a tilted photograph of an easel on the ground. Above these are five metal strips of film clips showing  glances between several characters. The whole is  assembled on the wall in the configuration of an easel.",
