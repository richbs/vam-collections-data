NUNO designers are renowned for their ability to develop and apply the latest technology to textile design and manufacture.  However, much of their work is also based on traditional Japanese textile techniques and aesthetics, and it is this fusion of the traditional with the contemporary that makes NUNO fabrics so innovative.\n\nThis black sample swatch is made of woven polyester, and plastic. NUNO used a laminating technique to create this unorthodox fabric. Scraps of newspaper are scattered over a polyester organdy, sections of which are heat sealed under polyurethane pouches. When the fabric is washed only the plastic pouched areas remain as legible design elements.",
