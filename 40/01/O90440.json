Like many Arts and Crafts designs, this print of chrysanthemum buds and meandering leaves is inspired by the forms and colours of garden flowers. The chrysanthemum is also a motif much used in Japanese design and Wardle was very interested in Eastern patterns, travelling widely to collect ideas.\n\nThomas Wardle took over his father's silk dyeing business and was a founder member and president of the Silk Assocation. From 1875, together with William Morris, Wardle revived the craft of block printing and vegetable dyeing and he manufactured textiles by Morris & Co. Wardle also bought work from designers like Day, Crane, Butterfield and Voysey and was an early member of the Arts and Crafts Society. He imported silks from India which he dyed and over-printed at Leek, his printing works in Staffordshire, and often sold through Liberty's and Heal's. Wardle produced all the embroidery silks and printed silk and cotton ground fabric for the Leek Embroidery Society, which was directed by his wife.",
