She began to make embroidered textiles ten years after leaving the Slade and in 1975 became Head of the Department of Textiles at Goldsmiths College.  Walker's embroideries are figurative, stitched by hand or machine and wall hung.  She is interested in exploring ideas which relate to chance encounters, momentary glances and human vulnerability.\n'Lot's Wife' is based on the biblical story of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19).  Two angels tell Lot to leave Sodom with his family before the city is destroyed by the Lord.  Lot is advised to flee to the mountains and not look back at the act of destruction.  Lot's wife disobeys this command and glances behind her, and she is turned into a pillar of salt.",
