The Iris Workshops were part of this movement.  The potter (and painter), Alfred William.Finch (1854-1930), an Englishman brought up and educated in Brussels, had an international training and experience which he brought to Finland at the invitation of Louis Sparre, the founder in 1897 of the Workshops in Porvoo.  The Workshops also produced furniture, textiles and glass, all of it radical and influential, despite the Workshops' short existence.  After its closure in 1902, Finch went on to head the ceramics department at the Central School of Industrial Arts in Helsinki.",

Through him, Finch was introduced to a circle which included Julius Meier-Graefe who founded 'La Maison Moderne' in Paris in 1899. Finch sold Iris Workshops pottery through Meier-Graefe's shop and also 'L'Art Noveau', the shop owned by Siegfried (Samuel) Bing. Both shops were devoted to promulgating the new art and design styles. The bowl and mug are both marked with La Maison Moderne's monogram. Exhibited in 'Forty Years of Modern Design', Bethnal Green Museum, 1966 (no catalogue).'",
