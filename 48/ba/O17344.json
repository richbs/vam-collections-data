            "physical_description": "Etty was unusual amongst Victorian artists in devoting his career to painting the nude. Even as an established artist and Royal Academician, he visited the life-class regularly to draw from the model. The condemnation his work attracted focused on the earthy sensual character of his models. Unlike those who painted more acceptable nudes, he made no attempt to refine or perfect the female body, but represented recognisably real lower-class women. He was criticised in The Times for presenting his models 'in the most gross and literal manner' rather than aiming for the 'exquisite idealities' of Titian.  The career of life-model was thought to be perilously close to prostitution since it inevitably exposed even respectable girls to the possibility of sexual exploitation; and some commentators thought that the artist himself was at risk of seduction by any woman whose morals were such that she could appear naked before him. Thus Mary Magdalen, generally characterised as a prostitute, was a very appropriate subject in the context of this moral debate. This is an unusual version of the theme (which Etty painted repeatedly) which combines the seductive nudity and elaborate jewellery of the courtesan with the book, skull and crucifix which are the usual attributes of the penitent Magdalen.",

Apprenticed to a printer at Hull, moved to London 1805, entered the RA Schools 1807 and studied with Sir Thomas Lawrence. Early works were mainly portraits and nude studies; his first large figure composition was 'The Coral Finder' (1820). Exhibited 138 works at the RA between 1811 and 1850, and 77 at the BI 1811-47. Travelled abroad in 1815/6, 1822, and 1830, principally to Paris and Italy. Elected ARA 1824, RA 1828. A retrospective exhibition was held at the Society of Arts 1849. Died York 13 November 1849. His studio sale was at Christie's 6-10 and 13-14 May 1850. Most admired in his lifetime for his large mythological subjects, but now perhaps more appreciated for his less finished and smaller studies of the nude. \n\nLIT: A Gilchrist <i>Life of William Etty</i> 2 vols, 1855; W Gaunt and F G Roe <i>Etty and the Nude</i> Leigh-on-sea 1943; D Farr <i>William Etty</i> 1958 \n\n<b>Study of a Magdalen</b> \n811-1873 Neg 82642 \nCanvas, 53.9 x 63.5 cm (21\u00bc x 25 ins) \nPurchased 1873 \n\nAlthough described in previous catalogues as a 'nude female contemplating a crucifix', the 1873 <i>Inventory of Art Objects</i> adds that it is a study of a Magdalen, which is clearly evident. Gilchrist listed six paintings of the subject, of which only one, painted in 1845 and exhibited at the Society of Arts in 1849, could possibly be the present work. \n\nThe iconography is unusual in that it combines the nudity and elaborate earring of the courtesan Magdalen with the more traditional book, skull and crucifix of the penitent. \n\nPROV: Presumably William Wethered, his sale Christie's 27 February 1858 (105, 'The Magdalene Reclining, a skull and crucifix before her'), bought Hoskins \u00a311 11 s; acquired for \u00a315 by the museum 1873.\n\nEXH: ?Society of Arts 1849 (CXXI) \n\nLIT: <i>Gilchrist</i> II, p340; <i>Gaunt and Roe</i> pl 38; <i>Farr</i> no 29, p137 \"",
