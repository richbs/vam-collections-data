In his discussion of the shrine of Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi (d. 1273) in Konya (now known as the Mevlana Museum), Meinecke identifies V&A:1108 and 1109-1898 as part of a group of fragments  from the external tile revetment of the high drum that supports the dome over Mevlana's tomb. He dates this revetment to the restoration of the shrine carried out in AH 783 (AD 1381-2) under the patronage of the Karamanid emir Alaeddin Bey, who ruled from 1357 to ?1398. The tilework on the dome has been renewed several times since 1818.",
