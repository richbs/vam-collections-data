The majority of the toys were made in China for its own market.  \n\nSee additional notes\n\nHistorical significance: The toys are colourful and rather crude in comparison to Western examples and they do not fulfill the necessary safety standards in place by the 1970s.  Many of the toys are similar in standard to ones produced in europe in the 1920s and 1930s.  A number of the toys were made in Japan for the Chinese market and they do reflect the lower safety standards required.  At the same time Japanese toys for a Western market had much higher requirements.  Some of the Japanese toys were then copied and there are several examples of the Japanese `original' and the Chinese copy.\nMany of the toys reflect Chinese life and myths, the dragon, butterflies, frogs etc while other contemporary china - a woman driving a motorized plough.  Some of the toys, however, illustrate the curiosity of the Chinese people for all things foreign, a knight on horseback and a washing machine for example.\nUntil recently Chinese toys were not available in Europe unless they were specifically designed for the European market and that still remains the case.  Many plastic toys are made in Chinese factories but to Western designs; they are not really Chinese toys.\nThis collection, acquired by a person living and studying in China at a time when the country was beginning to open up following the normalisation of relations with the United States, reflects that individuality of the toy making before it was truly affected by outside forces.",
