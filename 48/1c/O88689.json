He may also have travelled to Naples, Venice and Bologna. Around 1731 Boucher returned to Paris where he rapidly gained the royal favour and interest from the private collectors. He was a very prolific artist and produced a wide range of artworks from pastoral paintings, porcelain and tapestry designs as well as stage designs influencing deeply the new Rococo movement.\n\nThis painting was executed by Boucher in 1763 and later exhibited at the Salon in 1765. It depicts two young shepherds on the edges of the wood and illustrates a typical Arcadian theme of love associated to music and innocent amusements. This work is a fine example of Boucher\u2019s oeuvre pervaded with mischievous pastoral scenes which would become the hallmark of his art and eventually of the whole rococo period.",

In 1725 he was commissioned by Jean de Julienne to undertake engravings after Watteau for the <i>Figures de diff\u00e9rents caract\u00e8res de paysages et d'\u00e9tudes</i>. In 1727 he was in Italy with Carle van Loo and on his return in 1731 he became an <i>agr\u00e9e</i> of the Acad\u00e9mie. Three years later he was called to Beauvais to design tapestries and ultimately became Inspector of the Paris Gobelins factory after Oudry's death in 1755. He was a profilic and popular painter, working for Louis XV and Madame de Pompadour. In 1765 he was appointed Director of the Acad\u00e9mie, and <i>Premier Peintre du Roi</i> in succession to Van Loo. \n     Boucher was the most important figure among the second generation of French rococo painters and he exerted considerable influence both in painting and in the decorative arts. \n\n<i>Lit.</i> A Michel, <i>Boucher</i>, 1906; P. de Nolhac, <i>Boucher</i>, 1907. \n\n\nManner of Fran\u00e7ois BOUCHER \n\n44 \nPASTORAL SCENE: SHEPHERD WITH PIPE, \nAND GIRL \nInscribed on fence on right \n<i>F.

            "historical_context_note": "Pastoral is a genre of painting whose subject is the idealized life of shepherds and shepherdesses set in an ideally beautiful and idyllic landscape. These scenes are reminiscent of the Arcadia, the Antique Golden Age that the Roman author Virgil (1St BC) described in the <i>Eclogues</i> and were at the time illustrated on the Roman wall paintings. The pastoral was reborn during the Renaissance, especially in Venice, in the oeuvre of such painters as Titian (ca. 1488-1576) and Giorgione (1477-1510), and gradually evolved over the centuries. In the 17th century in fact, the Arcadian themes were illustrated in the Roman school led by the painter Claude Lorrain (1604-1682) whereas a century later, Antoine Watteau (1684-1721) and his followers forged the new genre of <i>f\u00eates galantes</i>, which appears as a derivation of the pastoral. The pastoral became the hallmark of the Rococo movement in which Fran\u00e7ois Boucher's (1703-1770) elegant eroticism found his true expression. This tradition, which had became an illustration of the carefree aristocratic world, died with the French revolution and was never revived although the celebration of the timeless Mediterranean world in the oeuvre of such painter as Henri Matisse (1869-1954) may be seen as a continuing interest for the theme.\n\nThe present painting is signed and dated on the fence above the goat's head although the inscription is now hardly visible. Long considered to be a 19th century pastiche after the work of the French artist Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, evidences have shown that the painting was an authenitic work by the French painter and this attribution was subsequently confirmed by M. Alastair Laing. \n\nThe painting was in fact exhibited at the Salon in 1765 and appears in Diderot's review, which gives a very negative account about it. \n\n374-1901 depicts a pastoral scene set on the edges of a wood with a young shepherd playing a pipe and a shepherdess in the act of giving him a crown of olive branches. A dog and a sheep complete the composition. \n\nThis painting may derived from an earlier composition by Boucher entitled <i>Le Berger r\u00e9compens\u00e9</i>, 1749, the Wallace collection, London. There are several compositions of the same theme executed by Boucher in the 1740s, which recurs throughout his career: <i>Pensent-ils aux Raisins?</i>, 1747, Art Institute of Chicago and <i>Le joueur de flageolet</i>, 1746,  whereabouts unknown, while especially close to our painting is <i>A summer Pastoral</i> (original title: <i>La couronne accord\u00e9e au berger</i>). \n\nThe two-year gap between the execution of the painting in 1763 and its exhibition at the Salon in 1765 may be explained by a series of facts. Boucher had just been appointed \u2018Premier Peintre du Roi\u2019 in 1765 and as such was required to show as many works as possible at the Salon. Due to a recent illness, he did not have enough pictures to present and had to include slightly earliest paintings such as the present one. But the repetition of his motifs and the lack of pictorial invention in these late works was deeply condemned by the crictics. \n\nThe taste for pastoral scenes was particularly vivid in France in the first half of the 18th century and goes back to a long literary tradition that could be traced back to Honor\u00e9 d\u2019Urf\u00e9\u2019s <i>Astr\u00e9e</i> and the writings of Madeleine de Scud\u00e9ry to Petrarch\u2019s <i>Bucolica</i> and Virgil\u2019s <i>Eclogues</i> and finally to the <i>Idylls</i> of the greek poet Theocritus. In the 18th century, <i>Les amours pastorales de Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9</i>, published in 1718, became the favourite book of the fashionable Parisian society. The ladies strated using the pastoral fantasy as a code. For instance, if a lady was dressing in the guise of a shepherdess, she was declaring her disposition for love.\n\nThe pastoral imagery pervaded with putti, mythological figures, shepherds and shepherdesses in idyllic landscapes created by Boucher would become the hallmark of the Rococo movement, which started to wane toward the end of the 18th century.",
