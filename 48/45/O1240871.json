It shows the pioneering technique of steam-bending beechwood into metal moulds to create curvilinear elements which, when assembled, perfectly reflect the method of manufacture. Thonet chairs were first made in a workshop, then in factories in which the family themselves designed and made all the manufacturing equipment and fittings. This very early example of this model is a mixture of solid wood for the arms and legs, and laminated wood for the back. The capitals at the top of the front legs add stability to the relatively thin legs and would be abandoned in later examples. This chair was continuously manufactured for more than 75 years.",
