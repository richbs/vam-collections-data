It allowed the artist to make fine lines in several contrasting colors, which meant that patterns of increased complexity were possible. Here the artist has decorated the jug's body with an interlace of vegetal motifs, while the tall neck is covered with a repeating geometric pattern.",

The blue and turquoise are painted into the raw glaze before firing and the black and red added in a separate firing. Morgan (1994) has divided mina'i wares into three ctaegories; with relief decoration (non-figural), without relief decoration (non-figural) and without relief decoration (figural). This jug falls into the second category. Mina'i wares share three main characteristics. They are made with a white composite fabric; they are covered with an opaque white or occasionally opaque turquoise glaze which reaches the edge of the foot ouside and is applied seperately in the vertical footring and thirdly the polychrome colours are applied over the glaze.",
