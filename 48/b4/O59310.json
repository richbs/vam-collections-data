The top is edged in gilt brass and top supported on a central shaft in the form of a palm stem, with applied decoration in composition, painted and gilded. It rises from a triangular base with concave sides, veneered in an unidentified burr wood; the outer points of the base are set with winged lions or leopards in patinated bronze, bearing lacquered brass staffs on their heads, supporting the outer edges of the table.\n\n<u>Construction</u>\nThe table top is built with a central hexagonal core, surrounded by six shaped cleat panel, presumably attached with tongue and grove joints.  The underside of the top is counter-veneered with oak, to balance the effect of the thuya veneers on the top surface, and both show tearing at the joints of the boards. Under the edge of the top is a lipping piece of oak, the curves cut from the solid, in sections of variable length. The gilt-brass edge mount is a particularly fine casting, made in section approximately 42 cm long, brazed together. \n\nThe central support is in oak, with applied decoration in composition, painted and gilded.  The outer shafts of lacquered brass, rising from the heads of the leopards, are screwed into wooden blocks at the top.",

It was made for the Ch\u00e2teau in about 1802, during the period when Napoleon ruled France as First Consul. Even before he became Emperor of France in 1804, he set in motion grand schemes of refurbishment for the royal palaces, including Saint-Cloud. His patronage was extremely important to the cabinet-makers and upholsterers and re-established the market for luxury goods in Paris after the Revolutionary years. This table was recorded in a watercolour of the Salon des Officiers de Service at Saint Cloud in 1863, at a time when Napoleon's nephew, Napoleon III was ruling France.",

It was probably commissioned by the dealer in luxury goods (<i>marchand-mercier</i>) Martin-\u00c9loi Lignereux (1750-1809) for the re-furnishing of the Palais de Saint-Cloud for Napoleon. In 1805 it was in the salon of the Emperor in the <i>cour d'honneur</i>.  \n\nThe design relates to a drawing by the designer Charles Percier (1764-1838) for a table with mosaic top intended for the Elys\u00e9e Palace in Paris It shows a similar table, but with a heavier central shaft, of double-baluster form. This drawing is illustrated in Hector Lefuel, <i>Fran\u00e7ois-Honor\u00e9-Georges-Jacob-Desmalter,</i> Paris, Editions Albert Moranc\u00e9, 1925, pl. XXII).  On that drawing, the lions or leopards are sitting back on their haunches rather than sitting up, as here. \n\nThe table appears to be the one shown later in the centre of the <i>Salon des Officiers de service</i> in a watercolour by Jean-Baptiste Fortun\u00e9 de Fournier (1798-1864), painted in 1863 and now in the collections of the Ch\u00e2teau de Compi\u00e8gne (inv. no. C.72D.7). This room served as the private sitting-room of Napoleon III and a version of the watercolour, showing the Emperor sitting at the writing table to the right was published by Mario Praz, 'An Illustrated History of Interior Decoration, from Pompeii to Art Nouveau' (London, Thames &amp; Hudson, 1964, p. 355, fig. 358.  This watercolour was with the dealer Fabius Fr\u00e8res at the time of publication. \n\nMiss Sanderson Stewart, who gave the table to the Museum in 1939, wrote in the acquisiton papers (RP 39/823): 'My father bought it in Versailles in I think 1877 from an old dealer who had it straight from the fire at St. Cloud.  At the same time Father bought some quite good Louis XVI pieces which I also have'. (Nominal File: Miss A. Sanderson Stewart).
