The monogram, variously transcribed in the museum records as FHC(?) and FAC, is not clear. The 'T' takes the form of the Greek letter Tau, which gave its name to the tau cross, a staff carried by a bishop or abbot. The decoration combines religious and secular motifs in an unusual form.\n\nThe sanctus or altar bell probably originated in the 12th century, when the elevation of the host was introduced to the Mass. These bells were frequently made in precious metals and were often given to the church by members of the congregation or clergy.",
