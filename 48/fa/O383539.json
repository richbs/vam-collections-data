Pilgrims to the Holy Land frequently passed through Cyprus, and the Cypriot goldsmiths absorbed influences from Western Europe as well as Ottoman Turkey.  Their work is similar to jewellery from elsewhere in the region, but the quality is often higher.  For their finest work they used niello or filigree.  The goldsmiths of Cyprus were famous for their filigree, often enriched with coloured enamels.  \n\nThis filigree case was described as a purse when it was bought, but it has also been described as a talisman holder.  The circular shape and the chain with decorative rosettes show that it was intended to look like a watch case, an essential accessory for all wealthy men throughout the Ottoman Empire.  Its name, ambousta, derives from an Italian word meaning \u2018container\u2019.",
