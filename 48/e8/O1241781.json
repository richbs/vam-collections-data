The farm building remained her private space once she was married, serving as a sanctuary and as a place to develop her stories and sketches. The Heelises lived at Castle Cottage which bordered Hill Top\u2019s land. \n\nThis sepia drawing of the farmhouse sets it within the context of its surroundings, with the dry stone walls bordering the farmland visible in the foreground, and the mountainous backdrop of the Lake District terrain.\n\nBeatrix Potter (1866-1943) is one of the world's best-loved children's authors and illustrators. She wrote the majority of the twenty-three original Peter Rabbit books between 1901 and 1913. The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale",
