            "public_access_description": "Nobles employed squire-carvers to cut meat at table as part of the dining ritual Carvers used two knives, one to cut the meat, the other to hold it steady, and carry slices to the diners. Knives were both portable and personal objects. The leather sheath for these knives has loops to attach it to the carver's belt, and the painted coat of arms on the sheath indicates the owner, but is now defaced and impossible to identify.\nOwning fine cutlery in the 15th century was a sign of wealth, elegance and refinement. Using elaborate carving knives and cases lent dignity and splendour to the serving of meals in noble households.The wealthy and the nobility employed Squire Carvers to cut and serve meat in a ritualised performance. At the beginning of a meal the carver laid the knives on the table pointing towards the master. To emphasise that this was not a threatening gesture, he would cover them with a white cloth.  The religious inscriptions on the knife reflect the owner's piety.\n\nThe knife was the main eating implement in Europe until the middle of the 17th century. The basic form of the table knife was quite different from these, and was a single-edged blade more or less pointed, with a handle, which has remained virtually the same since Antiquity, although the details of construction, shape and decoration have varied. Smaller knives used for cutting and eating, were similarly kept in portable cases as it was normal practice for everyone to carry their own cutlery. Dinner hosts, from nobles to inns and hostels, rarely provided cutlery so it remained individual and personalised.",

However, there exists a number of carving knives with handles of silver-gilt, enriched with transluscent enamel, mostly bearing the arms of Philip III, Duke of Burgund,y as assumed by him n October 1430.
