They fastened their clothes with decorative hooks, usually linked to each other by lengths of chain.  These were worn across the front of the dress, across the back of the head linking the earrings to the head cloth, and down the front of the skirt. \n\nThis piece was worn on the breast.  The two hooks at the ends of the chains were fastened to the front edges of a waistcoat or jacket.  The central plaque has a sharp vertical hook on its back which would have been hooked into the clothing to keep the whole thing firmly in place.  It may have been worn alone, but  its owner probably added more clasps and chains down the front of her jacket, with a larger matching clasp at the waist.  This chain was bought for \u00a31 13s. at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.\n\nThe double-headed eagle on the central boss is a symbol of imperial power.  It was widely used throughout the Balkans, by both Christians and Muslims.",
