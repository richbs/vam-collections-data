Deaf and partially dumb from a childhood accident. Pupil of Joseph Farington, who mentions him several times in his famous <i>Diary</i>, then Sir Thomas Lawrence, whose studio assistant he became. Successful portrait painting practice, with several distinguished sitters; some portraits were engraved. Exhibited 217 portraits at the RA between 1804 and 1857, one at the BI 1819, and four at the SBA 1832. Moved to Ipswich, Suffolk, 1853, where he died 29 July 1859. \n\n<b>Captain H B Murray, as a Youth </b>\nP4-1911 Neg 35313 \nCanvas, 34.8 X 29.5 cm (13\u00beX 11 5/8ins) \n\nPresented by Colonel Sir Wyndham and Lady Murray 1911 \nThe donor was the brother of the sitter. According to a label on the frame, the sitter was aged 17 and his dates are given as 1843-1910; if the attribution to Lane is correct (and there is no reason to doubt it), this information must be slightly inaccurate, as Lane died in 1859. Captain Henry Boyles Murray bequeathed his collection, notably porcelain and metalwork (and including a landscape by Jan van Goyen, P40-1910), to the museum in 1910, together with the sum of \u00a350,000 for future acquisitions. \nLane exhibited a portrait of the Rev Thomas Boyles Murray (1798-1860) at the RA in 1852 (546); the present portrait is presumably of one of his three sons. \n\nPROV: Presumably bequeathed by the sitter on his death in 1910 to his brother, the donor \n\nEXH: <i>Samuel Lane Centenary Exhibition</i> King's Lynn Town Hall 1959 \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
