The X-frame supports, the carved decoration and the use of chamfered or bevelled edges are details taken from buildings and church woodwork by the designer. This table is part of a large collection of furniture that he designed for a house in Sussex.\n\nPeople\nA. W. N. Pugin (1812-1852) was the designer most closely associated with the Gothic Revival in Britain. He used his knowledge of Medieval buildings, their decoration, fittings and furniture to produce an enormous range of designs.  A furniture manufacturer, John Webb, who also made furniture for Pugin's most important commission, the Palace of Westminster, in London, supplied it in 1852-1853.\n\nTime\nIn 1849, A. W. N. Pugin, the designer, asked his collaborator, J. G. Crace, to make simple furniture in the Gothic Style, as this would be more suitable for modest houses. This table is an example of that kind of furniture.\n\nPlace\nHorsted Place, Sussex was built by George Myers for Francis Blanchard in 1850-1851. The house was furnished with a large collection of furniture designed by A. W. N. Pugin.",

Simplicity and honesty in design were central principles applied to furniture in the Gothic style. This form of pegged construction and the X-frame bracing became, during the 1840s, two of the most significant and exciting of Pugin's innovations in furniture design and can be seen in the surviving pieces supplied by Webb for the House of Lords.",
