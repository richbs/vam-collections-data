            "public_access_description": "This fashion plate by Georges Gorvel is from the journal Gazette du Bon Ton. The journal featured articles about theatre, travel and other pursuits of interest to the leisured wealthy, but the main emphasis was always on fashion. It was published from November 1912 to the summer of 1915, and again from January 1920 to December 1925. The complete run consisted of 12 volumes. It was intended for the Parisian \u00e9lite, and introduced fashions in colour plates such as this one. The contributors included many prominent artists of the time, and the colour plates anticipated the Art Deco style that was to dominate the 1920s. The illustrations were stencilled by hand with watercolour, in a technique known as pochoir.\n\nThis fashion plate from 1920 shows a man in evening dress, with tails and a top hat. It is a simple and effective image of a tall and elegant man smoking. The only splash of colour is his yellow glove. Despite the simplicity of the image, it communicates glamour.",
