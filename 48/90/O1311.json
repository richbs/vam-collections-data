In some cases they copied existing historic examples very closely. Sometimes their work was so successful that it was soon being sold in antiques markets. This goblet was closely copied from a fragmentary beaker that came to light when the campanile, or bell-tower, in St Mark's Square in Venice collapsed in 1902. This copy was made in the following year by 'The Venice and Murano Glass Company Ltd' with the intention to supply it to \u2018Museums, Collectors and others wishing to posses an interesting relic of the Campanile of St Mark\u2019. It was indeed bought by the V&A in 1903 for that very reason.",
