Lucile was born Lucy Sutherland in 1863. She began dressmaking for friends, and in 1891 opened her own fashion house. She married Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon in 1900. Lady Duff Gordon became a celebrated fashion designer with branches in New York (1909), Chicago (1911) and Paris (1911). \n\nThis brown silk tailored costume was worn by Heather Firbank (1888-1954), daughter of the affluent Member of Parliament Sir Thomas Firbank and sister of the novelist Ronald Firbank. In 1960 the Museum acquired well over 100 items from her wardrobe. This collection forms an invaluable record of a stylish and wealthy woman's taste between about 1905 and 1920. Miss Firbank patronised many of the top London fashion houses of the period, and a large amount of her clothes were purchased from Lucile whose shop on Hanover sq was just around the corner from the Firbank's Mayfair apartment. Many items were shown in an exhibition at the Museum in  1960: 'Lady of Fashion: Heather Firbank and what she wore between 1908 and 1921'.",
