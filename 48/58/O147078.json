He has worked in many materials: stones, bronze, steel and aluminium as well as making extensive use of enamel and uncut stones. In 1969, he worked with Louis Osman on the manufacture of the crown for the investiture for the Prince of Wales. He has collaborated with other jewellers such as the enameller Jane Short and in these pieces, with Malcolm Appleby. \n\nMalcolm Appleby trained as a gun engraver and is one of the foremost engravers working today. As a jeweller, he was able to see the possibilities offered by the fine quality, textured steel used in gun barrels, exploited both in his own work and supplied to other jewellers.",
