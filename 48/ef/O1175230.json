Her double breasted jacket fastens in three buttoned rows and has a wide black trimmed neckline and black cuffs. There also appear to be further rows of buttons reaching from her cuffs to her elbows. Her pale grey, shin length, skirt is relatively plain, the primary decoration being the verticle row of large grey buttons which run from the waist to the hem. A dark green sash decorated with a black fringe, intricate black embroidery is suspended from her waist. Her hat is also black with a deep, upturned, green brim and pale grey bow. Her gloves are white and her boots are pale grey. There are further sketches in pencil showing details from the dress surrounding the design. The design is neither signed nor dated but is likely to have been drawn by Comelli in circa 1921.",

            "public_access_description": "Costume design for the actress May Beatty (1880-1945) in the role of Margot Poire (wife of the impressario Charles Poire) in a production of Sybil at Daly's Theatre, 1921. The design is neither signed nor dated but is likely to have been drawn by Comelli in circa 1921.\n\nSybil, or Szibill in the original Hungarian is an operetta with music by Victor Jacobi. The story follows Sybil, a singer from Paris, who arrives in Russia and meets an officer, Petrov who falls in love with her. There follows a case of mistaken identity in which Sybil is thought to be the wife of the Grand Duke. The Grand Duke goes along with this deception and his wife pretends to be Sybil. The Grand Duchess then becomes attracted to Petrov and the Grand Duke tries to attack him. After much confusion everyone's true identity is revealed and the play ends happily.\n\nMay Beatty (1880-1945) was born in New Zealand in 1880. She achieved the greatest success as musical comedy began to gain popularity in the late 1890s playing the heroine in musicals such as La poup\u00e9e, The belle of New York , The Geisha and Florodora. She first came to England in 1906 and by the early 1920s was appearing in a revival of The Shop Girl at the Gaiety Theatre in 1920 and the following year in Sybil at Daly's Theatre. \n\nComelli (1858-1925) was the house designer of the Royal Opera House from the late 1880s to the early 1920s. During this period he also worked for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and also designed costumes from a number of Gilbert&Sullivan productions.\n\nThis production of the play opened at Daly's Theatre, London on 19th February 1921.",
