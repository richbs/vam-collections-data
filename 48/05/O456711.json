The long sleeves are cut all in one with the main body of the garment and there is no seam across the top of the shoulders.\nThe neckband is stiffened and fastens at the front with a triple floret which comes together with one knot button secured through a loop.

This fastening format is repeated on FE.39-1995.\nThe dress is edged with three narrow borders: green and blue satin and a textured yellow and gold woven material, this last identical to that on FE.39-1995. The base of the neck has a quadruple border: two blue satin edges (one flat and one tubular), one green satin and one yellow textured.\nThere is a blue satin hook sewn inside the back of the neck.\n\n Front side fastening with 5 loop and knot buttons.
