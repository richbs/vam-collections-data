They are usually associated with West Africa but were originally created in Europe, particularly Venice, Bohemia and the Netherlands. The history of trade beads dates to the 15th century when Portuguese trading ships arrived on the coast of West Africa to exploit its many resources, including gold, slaves, ivory and palm oil. At that time, beads were a major part of the currency exchanged for people and products. The beads traded were not of a set form, but were produced according to demand, which could vary from region to region, resulting in many thousands of different designs. The cost of producing the beads declined as glassmaking technologies developed and, for Europeans, the beads provided a cheap and efficient means of exploiting African resources.\n\nA label attached to the beads notes that they may be examples of \u2018popo\u2019 beads. Little Popo (in today\u2019s Togo) and Grand Popo (in Benin) were settlements on the west coast of Africa, an area commonly known to Europeans as the \u2018Slave Coast\u2019 for its importance to the transatlantic slave trade.",
