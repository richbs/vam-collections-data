George III reigned from1760 to 1820 and succeeded his grandfather, George II, as monarch.\n\nTurnerelli (1774-1839) was the son of an Italian immigrant father and Irish mother. He became a highly successful sculptor specialising in portrait busts. He entered the Royal Academy schools in October 1794. Visited Rome in 1796 and was highly influenced by the neo-classical style although he introduced contemporary costume into his portraiture. In 1797 he was appointed to instruct the Royal Princesses in modelling. He frequently exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1802 to 1839, including numerous busts of the Royal Family.",
