            "bibliography": "<u>100 Great Paintings in The Victoria & Albert Museum.</u> London: V&A, 1985, p.202\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Graham Sutherland 1903-1980\n<i>British School</i> \nTHE WANDERER I 1940 \nWater-colour, 21.7 X 35.9 cm \nP.20-1975 \n\nThis sketch relates to Sutherland's first and only work for the theatre. He was commissioned to design two backcloths, and the costumes, for Frederick Ashton's ballet <i>The Wanderer</i>, which was first performed by the Sadler's Wells Ballet at the New Theatre, London, on 27 January 1941. The costumes attracted a good deal of criticism, but the two backcloths (the other was based on a painting, <i>Mountain Road With Boulders</i>, 1940) were much admired. They were considered to be most appropriate to Schubert's music and Ashton's choreography. \n\nThere is another version of this design in the collection of the Hon. Colette Clark. The two are broadly similar, but there are some variations of colour and detail. Both drawings have been squared for enlargement, but the process has been completed, by the addition of diagonals, only in the Clark sketch, which is in fact the one actually reproduced for the stage production. The V&A drawing is rather more detailed than the final version, which discarded the corn stooks, and the bushes to the left, and replaced the strong yellow with a glowing red. In its finished form the composition is more upright, and includes rather more foreground. \n\nThe strong, bright, rather acid colour is typical of Sutherland's work of this period, as is his method of using crayon with a semi-transparent wash, so that one colour shines through another. A low sun casting long shadows was a favourite motif, which he used to increase the dramatic character of the landscape. It also serves as a device to create a sense of space, which is otherwise lost in Sutherland's flattened forms. \n\nSutherland's inspiration at this time was drawn from the rugged scenery of the Pembrokeshire coast, which he had first discovered in 1934. He described the power of this Welsh landscape in 1942:\n \n<i>'The quality of light here is magical and transforming ...\nWatching from the gloom as the sun's rays strike the further bank, \none has the sensation of the after tranquillity of an</i>explosion <i>of \nlight; or as if one had looked into the sun and turned suddenly away.'</i> \n\nLight has the power to transfigure and metamorphose in these landscapes: they are imaginative 'paraphrase' rather than direct transcript. This brilliant fantasy landscape is very close in style and mood to the Pembrokeshire subjects, and it clearly reveals Sutherland's debt to the visionary works of Blake and Palmer.\n\nGillian Saunders\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
