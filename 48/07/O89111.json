This supporting ring is evidently a test piece for a guild examination, and the fact that a piece of cast work was chosen for such an exercise indicates that the trade considered casting skills as critical to the craft.\n\nThe examinee would be alloted a workshop and would be required to produce a sample within a specified time. The examination was supervised by the guild and if the candidate's work was considered satisfactory, he would be presented (before the assembled members) by his sponsor as a new master.",
