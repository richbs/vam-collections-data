            "public_access_description": "The inro is a container made up of tiers. Japanese men used them because the traditional Japanese garment, the kimono, had no pockets. From the late 1500s onwards, Japanese men wore the inro suspended from their sash by a silk cord and a netsuke (toggle). They originally used it to hold their seal and ink or a supply of medicines. However, it rapidly became a costly fashion accessory of little or no practical use. Most inro are rectangular with gently curving sides. \nLacquer was most commonly used in the manufacture of inro since it was highly suitable for storing medicines. Lacquer is the sap from the tree Rhus verniciflua that grows mainly in East Asia. After processing, it is applied in many thin layers to a base material.  The craft of lacquering, as well as making inro bodies, is highly complex, time-consuming and expensive. In this example, the black lacquer is inlaid with tiny pieces of gold foil and shell in intricate patterns. In this technique known as aogai (\u2018blue-green shell\u2019), a highly iridescent shell is used. The pieces are grouped in shades of blue, green, pink and violet, resulting in a rich, colourful effect.  \nThis inro is decorated with a peacock and peahen in a distinctive design closely based on one in the Ehon tsuhoshi (Picture book on various subjects). This was first published in 1729 and illustrated by Tachibana Morikuni.",
