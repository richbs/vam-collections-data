Only the unmarried and prostitutes wore their hair loose.  \n\nHair pins were worn throughout the country.  Those with round filigree heads, like this one, mainly come from the south.  They were worn at the back of the head, piercing and securing the thick braids of hair.  They were inserted diagonally or horizontally, so that the decorative heads stuck out at the side of the face.  The number of pins worn varied by district.  In some places they were worn all round the head, like a fan, but the largest were usually worn singly or in pairs.\n\nThis design is called \u2018limoncello e carofano\u2019, meaning 'a little lemon with a sprouting top'.  It is typical of hair pins from the Campania region around Naples.  It has silver marks which show it was made in southern Italy between 1835 and 1863.  \n\nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
