He uses both traditional metals and materials, but also explored a number of unconventional materials transformed through labour-intensive processes. In this piece he has applied an inlay to the ebony and lacquer.\n\nGentille studied painting and sculpture before becoming a goldsmith. In spite of his training he considers himself as self-taught and proud of his interdisciplinary approach. For him the concept of a piece is as important as skilled craftsmanship.",
