The owner is in financial difficulties & tells me his father (a dealer, I think) paid \u00a330 for it, which I can well believe. At \u00a315 it seems to me a bargain we ought to secure, & we have nothing really like it.' The style and subjects depicted suggest this piece is German, and dates from the mid-seventeenth century. \nBought for \u00a315 from Maurice d'Alva, London in 1921.",
