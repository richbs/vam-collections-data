The chair has low, rectangular-sectioned stretchers on all sides, with additional ones set slightly higher on both sides. The seat is of planks, rebated into the seat rails, giving a slight lip to locate a cushion.  The mid-rail of the back is carved on the front face with formalised tulips and leaves. The chair-rail is carved as an arcade of three round-headed arches, supported on two turned columns set between this and the mid-rail, with two turned pilasters set against the side faces of the back uprights. The opening of each arch is set with an acorn-shaped turned knop and two of these are found on the top of the chair rail.",

Although London might provide the most expensive furniture to clients in any part of Britain, local styles remained strong well into the 19th century.  This chair is typical of the kind of chair produced in South Yorkshire or Derbyshire from about 1670-1700.  The pierced arcade of the back and the little inward-facing scrolls at the top of the back uprights are motifs very regularly found on furniture from that area. One motif on this chair that gives it distinction is the carving on the uprights below the back panel.  The edges of the rectangular section of wood have been chamfered, to create the outline of a fashionable baluster shape.\n\nOn loan to Provost Skeen's House.",
