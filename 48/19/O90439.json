It has a pierced cover and was used for casting or sprinkling sugar, salt, ground pepper and spices or dry mustard powder over food. Silver and Sheffield plate pounce boxes were popular items of tableware. Brass examples, like this one, were less common. \n\nThis piece was made in Birmingham in the period 1700-1800. At this time Birmingham was an established centre for skilled metalwork.  Brass founding was established there by the 1690s and after 1700 the numbers of brass founders increased rapidly. By the 1790s there were 71 separate brass foundries established in the city. Birmingham had become the centre of brass manufacturing in Britain, producing a vast range of domestic utensils for a national and international market.",
