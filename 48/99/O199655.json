It shows the very early stages of a potentially ambitious plan. This design differs greatly from the finished product, demonstrating how significant changes can take place during the design process.\n\nNow in the Metalwork collection, these cloisonn\u00e9 candlesticks were commissioned by the V&A and funded with the assistance of Mrs Rita Gans in memory of her husband Mr Jerry Gans. The cloisonn\u00e9 technique is common in the production of jewellery and is achieved by creating sections over the body of the overall shape of the object using silver wire. The sections are then filled with coloured enamels and fired. The filigree wire borders delineate these sections within the design lending a more vivid quality to the enamelling.",
