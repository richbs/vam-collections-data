The machine net is decorated with heavy tambour work, cut-work, simple machine-made filling stitches and with applied, raised motifs of Swiss chemical lace and couched cord cordonnets.\n[Skirt] Skirt cut from one length of net and flared around the hem by the insertion of an extra net within the decorative medallions and narrowed towards the waist along the gore-lines of the design. The only visible seam is up the centre back but the skirt gives the appearance of a five-panelled gored skirt, with a flared hemline and a slight train. The embroidery is designed to emphasise this effect. Open-work gore-lines run vertically up the skirt and in the panels between are hanging baskets of flowers, tied with ribbons and entwined with garlands. Curving lines of ribbons run around the skirt, two-thirds of the way down it. Below this are elaborate medallions enclosing wreaths and swags of flowers. Further lines of tiny linked medallions and of sprays and garlands of flowers emphasise the full, deeply scalloped hemline. The hemline at the front of the skirt has been altered by the addition of a second row of small scallops probably to lengthen the dress.\n[Bodice] Bodice, altered on the shoulders, around the arm-holes and down the centre back, is embroidered in shape. In the centre front is a basket of flowers tied with a ribbon. Matching sprays of roses fill the two back panels. The shaped waist and neck lines are defined by scroll work and by rows of linked medallions. \n[Dress panel] Dress panel cut from a larger sleeve. Decorated with a central wreath of flowers hanging from a large ribbon bow. Above is a more densely patterned area of linked medallions and below are more delicate trails of leafy stems.\n[Dress panel] Dress panel cut from a larger sleeve.
