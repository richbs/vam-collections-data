Their sound was similar to that of the violin but they were played between the legs rather than underneath the chin. Fran\u00e7ois Gavini\u00e9s (ca.1683-1772) made this instrument in Bordeaux some time before moving to Paris in 1734. Although the peg-box and neck of this instrument are probably later replacements, the fingerboard may be original. Tortoiseshell fingerboards were a characteristic of Gavini\u00e9s' surviving viols.",
