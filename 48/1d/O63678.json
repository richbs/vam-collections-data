Neither of these gifts were to my taste.  I wished they had taken me for the drive & I would have chosen better, although I much admired the lovely lady on the cover.  I had made up my mind that my present was to be some tiny green frogs who changed colour with the plant they sat on.  I had explained to both of them what I wished for.  A glass home for the frogs with a ladder & a pretty little pond.  How disappointed I was.'  Also enclosed was Taglioni's calling card inscribed by her with address \"44 Upper Brook Street / Grosvenor Square\"  \nThe sewing kit is part of a unique collection of memorabilia and personal effects which evoke Marie Taglioni in the last decades of her life.  She was a keen needlewoman and  the collection contains examples of her own work, her personal sewing accessories and related gifts she made to Margaret Rolfe, whose interest in sewing was evidently negligible.  \nA collection of Taglioni memorabilia was amassed by Margaret Rolfe, the granddaughter of Taglioni's closest friend in London, Mrs Boggs Rolfe; she attended Taglioni's dancing classes and received many gifts of Taglioni memorabilia, from Taglioni herself, from her grandmother and, after Taglioni's death, from her niece, Marguerite Troubetzkoi.  She kept these, with a series of related notes, in various boxes and annotated envelopes (filed separately).  These she passed to Cyril Beaumont, probably for the London Archives of the Dance (a number of the objects were referred to in \"The London Archives of the Dance and some of its Treasures\" by Cyril Beaumont, Ballet Annual, first issue, Adam & Charles Black, London, 1947, p110); the Archives never achieved an independent home and part of the collection, including the Taglioni memorabilia, was stored with Cyril Beaumont, where it became inextricably mixed with his own collection and came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.",
