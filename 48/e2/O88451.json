Initially there were many basic similarities between the two. Those in brass copied the tapering profile of  wooden buckets and were decorated with horizontal lines encircling the rim, centre and base--reminiscent of the metal hoops holding the staves together. Gradually craftsmen began to evolve forms particular to brass. Buckets were cast with a circular stepped foot which could be decorated with a pattern of perforations. Inscriptions around the side of the vessel were sometimes incorporated on the more elaborate examples. Handles were often a single iron hoop but again there were variations: on some examples, the double hooped handle in cast brass more commonly associated with lavabos was used. This example is decorated with a foliage pattern interspersed with shields of arms.\n\nBuckets were also produced for secular use but the stylistic variations were undoubtedly prompted by ecclesiastical commissions. Throughout the Middle Ages, church art was more susceptible to changes of fashion than the highly conservative domestic market.",
