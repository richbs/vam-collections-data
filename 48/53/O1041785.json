            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 215, 218, 219\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\n \"Page from a sketch-book.\n\nOn the back is a pencil drawing of the avenue of trees leading from the Petersham Plate 261 ham road to Ham House. \nIn his letter of 30 August 1834 to Leslie (P. Leslie, p. 121) Constable says \"I have been twice at Ham House lately. Lady Dysart is old and rather more infirm, but well. . . We must go there to see the House, it seems as if its inmates of a century and a half back were still in existence & that on opening of the doors some of them would appear\". Letters of September 1834 speak of further visits paid by Constable to Ham in that month (P. Leslie, pp. 122 and 127). \n\nNote on Nos. 362-368 [217-1888, 211-1888, 204-1888, 277-1888, 208-1888, 223-1888, 818-18888]\n\nThese drawings evidently come from the same sketch-book, the leaves of which measure approximately 140 x 235 mm. (about 5 \u00bd x 9 1/4 ins.). The dates on Nos. 363 [211-1888], 364 [204-18/88] verso and 365 [277-1888] show that Constable used it on his visit to Mr. George Constable of Arundel in July 1834. No. 362 [217-1888] may be assigned to the same visit on the evidence of the drawing of the same place in the British Museum, referred to in the note to that sketch. It may be presumed that Nos. 364[204-1888] recto, 366 [208-1888] and 367 [223-1888] were also made on this visit. The following leaves in the British Museum appear to come from the same sketch-book: L.B. 27a Bignor Park (see note on No. 362 [217-1888]); L.B. 27b Petworth 14 July 1834 (137 x 231 mm.); No. 1910-2-12-233 Windmill: man ploughing (137 x 233 mm.) (Salting Bequest). Holmes notes, p. 251, in Sir J. C. Robinson's sale (21 April 1902) a pencil drawing of Arundel Castle, Sunday morning. 20 July 1834 (5 x 9 ins.). The date and measurements suggest that this too may have been a page from the sketch-book. \nIn his letter of 16 July 1834 to Leslie, Constable says of the scenery he encountered on his visit: \"The Castle is the cheif ornament of this place-but all here sinks to insignificance in comparison with the woods, and hills. The woods hang from excessive steeps, and precipices, and the trees are beyond everything beautifull: I never saw such beauty in <i>natural landscape</i> before. I wish it may influence what I do in future, for I have too much preferred the picturesque to the beautifull-which will I hope account for the <i>broken ruggedness of my style</i> ... The meadows are lovely, so is the delightfull river, and the old houses are rich beyond all things of the sort--but the trees above all\" (Beckett, III, pp. 111-12).\u201d",
