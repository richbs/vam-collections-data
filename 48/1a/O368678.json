A large collection of rooms commissioned by her is in the Art Institute of Chicago. Nominal File: Thorne, Mrs James Ward, records the acquisition of the library, with correspondence running from 1935 to 1937. The model is a replica of one in the collection of Mrs Ward, shown in the Chicago Historical Society's Museum.  Photographs of these rooms had apparently been shown to Queen Mary at some time before 1935. When asked which room she like best, she chose the library. The replica was completed in 1937.Photographs of the furnished room exist on the Registerd File, showing a Palladian interior furnished with a Persian carpets, fitted bookshelves, a brass chandelier, and various pieces of different mid-Georgian furniture, including a japanned bureau cabinet and a Chinese lacquer screen.  All the furniture was scrupulously made to the scale of 1 inch to 1 foot.\n\nIn 1941 the model was damaged by bombing. The damage was described as 'extremely slight' but by the 1970s, it was deemed that restoration was not possible.  The furnishings were apparently destroyed but the model seems to have survived.",
