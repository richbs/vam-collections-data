Amazons were female warriors in Greek legend, but there were also historical Amazons, female Scythian warriors from an Iranian tribe renowned for their cavalry.  This may well represent an act featuring a female rider performed at Astley's Circus some time in the 1850s.\n\nEarthenware flatbacks and figurines for mantelpiece decoration were first produced in  Staffordshire in the late 1830s.  The earliest datable Staffordshire figures appear to be those of Queen Victoria, who was crowned in 1837.  Images of royalty proved a lucrative market and during the 1840s there were countless other royal figures issued by Staffordshire pottery firms. Although a few Staffordshire portrait figures were produced after Victoria's death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905.  During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. Since they were produced in moulds, they were relatively cheap and easy to make. As well as the royal family they represented a wide variety of subjects, those of actors and actresses being especially popular.",
