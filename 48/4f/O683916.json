The following is the full text of the entry: LANDI, GENNARO (worked late 18th century) 1037 Allegorical composition; a winged female figure about to write in a book supported on the shoulders of a figure of Time, while cupid seated on the ground holds up an hour glass Pen and ink and wash over red chalk; pricked for transfer 13 \u00bc x 16 \u00bd (336 x 419) 9115 PROVENANCE Unknown Italian collection (Lugt 2099); bought 1883 The words <i>Di Gennaro Landi</i> are printed on a slip of paper pasted on to the lower edge of the drawing, as described in Lugt 2099. A drawing of the Judgment of Paris stamped with the same collector\u2019s mark and labelled similarly <i>Di Gennaro Landi </i>was sold at Messrs Sotheby\u2019s 21 March 1924, lot 122. No. 1038 below is by the same hand. No artist named Gennaro Landi is recorded. Yet he may have existed. The style suggests a date in the late 18th century; the printed label and the collector\u2019s mark appear to be of the same period; so the collector was attributing his drawings to a contemporary artist.",
