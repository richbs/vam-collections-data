The Arts & Crafts firm Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. (founded in 1861) was instrumental in reintroducing the medium to the home. Simply coloured panels such as this one let through a great deal of light, making them ideal for decorating domestic settings.\n\nPeople\nThis panel, which depicts the 14th-century poet Geoffrey Chaucer, was designed by Edward Burne-Jones (1833-1898). He was by far the most prolific and influential of the stained-glass designers working with William Morris during this period.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe romantic writings of Chaucer exerted a powerful influence on the ideas and work of both Burne-Jones and Morris during their time studying at Oxford. This scene is the first in a series of seven relating the poet's 'Legend of Goode Wimmen' - in a dream the God of Love introduces Chaucer to heroines of antiquity who have suffered for love and reproaches the poet for the bad things he had written about women.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis series of designs was originally conceived by Burne-Jones in 1862 to decorate a set of tiles and was later adapted to make windows for the Surrey home of the watercolorist Myles Birket Foster (1825-1899). The panels displayed at the South Kensington Museum in 1864 were not these, but duplicates made by Morris & Co., especially for the show.",
