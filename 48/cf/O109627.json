The case was made to protect the monstrance so that it could easily be transported, stored or hidden when not in use. The monstrance may be a unique example of an English-made monstrance dating from before Catholic emancipation in 1829.\n\nHistorical significance: The few 18th century monstrances that survive in private English Catholic chapels were usually made on the continent. This is a rare example of a monstrance made in London for Catholic worship in England. In the 18th century this was centred on aristocratic families whose private chapels were attended by members of their household and members of the local community. Chapels attached to the leading London embassies welcomed Catholic Londoners.",

Catholics who refused to attend Church of England services were known as recusants and until the late 17th century they had to worship in secret. However, the Dukes of Norfolk and aristocratic families such as the Arundells at Wardour Castle encouraged Catholic communities to use their private chapels and so kept the faith alive.\n\nThe Catholic plate that survives from before the 1660s is mainly limited to chalices, paxes and pyxes. These earlier pieces are rarely marked. After 1688, Catholic plate was more often hallmarked and the range of forms expanded to include sanctuary lamps, cruets and incense boats. \n\nIn London, Catholics could worship openly in foreign embassy chapels. The silver from the Sardinian Embassy chapel can be seen in the case to the right. During the reign of Charles II, Catholic courtiers could also attend the queen\u2019s private chapel and that of the Queen Mother, Henrietta Maria.",
