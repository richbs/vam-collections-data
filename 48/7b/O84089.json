Based at 40 Great Marlborough Street, London, the Baccarat range was united by a soft, romantic look.\n\nThis long-line, two-piece ensemble has a refined design incorporating butterflies. It is based on a botanical engraving and is reminiscent of early 19th-century chintz fabrics. The suede lapels, which resemble enormous butterfly wings, extend to form a buttoned back belt. In keeping with the 1970s trend for mixing and matching fabrics, a second bold print is introduced in the skirt.",
