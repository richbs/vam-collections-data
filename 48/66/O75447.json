She is flanked by a nude boy carrying  a palm branch and a seated girl reading. A full-size plaster model of Truth was exhibited at the Rome International Exhibition in 1911 with a model of Justice. This cast was probably taken from Brock's second, more elaborate model for the Victoria memorial that was completed and approved by King Edward VII in 1902. Two further models for the Victoria memorial outside Buckingham Palace are also in the Museum's collections (inv. nos. A.7 and 8-1977). These three bronzes were given to the Museum by Mr and Mrs Roland Morris in 1977. Mr Roland Morris's father was William Thomas Morris (1874-1944), Chairman and Managing Director of the Morris Singer Company who cast the works.",
