Printed by Alf Cooke, Leeds, 1889. \n\n&lt;i&gt;Our Army and Navy&lt;/i&gt; opened on 1 April 1889 at the Alhambra Theatre, Leicester Square. In essence it was a revised version of the ballet &lt;i&gt;Le Bivouac&lt;/i&gt;, created in 1885 in response to the war in the Sudan and the death of General Gordon in Khartoum. The ballet was a patriotic work set in the Portsmouth docks and consisted largely of processions in formation.\n\nThe 'Dances and Evolutions' were arranged by Eugenio Casati to music selected, arranged and composed by Georges Jacobi. The costumes were made by Alias from designs by Lucien Besche, with accoutrements by Robert Bennett . The scenery representing Portsmouth harbour was by T.E. Ryan.\n\nSix of the costumes in the portfolio represent a nationality incorporating national insignia and/or flags in sashes with a background showing a \u2018typical\u2019 national scene,  and seven represent military uniforms worn by members of the British armed forces; the army and navy. The costumes were created for women performing \u2018en travestie\u2019 and emphasis the feminine body. \n\nThe ballet fell into three parts: The Assembly of the British servicemen; the Reception of Nations, and the March Past of the British with military exercises and sham fights, ending with &lt;i&gt;Rule Britannia&lt;/i&gt;.",
