Dating to the 18th to 19th century, the jar exemplifies the taste for plain, undecorated white porcelain that prevailed during the Choson dynasty. In contrast to the delicate celadon stonewares of the Koryo period (918-1392AD), Choson ceramics may be characterised by their strong and sturdy appearance and unfrivolous decoration as they clearly embodied the religious and philosophical ideals of the Neo-Confucian doctrine that was favoured by the ruling elite.",
