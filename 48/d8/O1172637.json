Tin toys cover a vast array of subject matters ranging from the space age to domestic objects. This plane was made in Japan by S&E. It was not until the fifties that the Japanese firms begun to make their own original designs. They were mainly concerned with the American market meaning that their toys reflect American culture in some way.\n\nThe Japanese tin toy production was at its peak in the 1960s. Increased labour costs and the demand for die cast models affected the production of tin toys and contributed to its decline in both quality and quantity, as well as plastic being used as a material for toys which was cheaper and safer than tin.",
