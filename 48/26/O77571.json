The Chinese factories made export goods to order, using European drawings, engravings, three-dimensional models or actual vessels as models.\n\nPlace\nChinese porcelain was exported to the West from several kilns in China.  The most productive were those in the city of Jingdezhen in Jiangxi Province.  However, some of the products most favoured by European consumers came from kilns at Dehua, in the south-eastern coastal province of Fujian.  These kilns were close to major export ports such as Amoy (Xiamen) or Canton (Guangzhou).\n\nMaterials & Making\nDehua porcelain was creamy-white, hard and very translucent. It was known in Europe as 'Blanc de Chine' and was one of the first types of porcelain to be copied, in factories such as Meissen.",
