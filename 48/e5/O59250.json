            "public_access_description": "The firm of Jacob-Desmalter made this chair. They were the most famous makers of furniture in Paris at the time. Georges Jacob had supplied fine carved furniture for the royal households before the French Revolution of 1789, when the monarchy was overthrown. During the revolutionary years he was careful to keep in favour with whichever government happened to be in power. In 1803 he went into partnership with his second son, Fran\u00e7ois-Honor\u00e9-Georges. For ten years this firm, under the name of Jacob-Desmalter, did a thriving business. They supplied furnishings for the palaces of the Emperor Napoleon and for his courtiers.",
