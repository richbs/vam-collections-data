Chorister in Chapel Royal, entered RA Schools 1821, winning gold medal 1824. In a long and successful career, exhibited 83 works at the RA between 1823 and 1879, 39 at the BI 1824-44, and eight at the SBA 1825-34. Early pictures were portraits and historical subjects, but following success of 'Rebels Shooting a Prisoner' (showing children at play) 1827, specialised in similar scenes, and of school and village life, comparable to those of Wilkie and Mulready. Influential and much admired, they became popular through engravings. Elected  ARA 1840, RA 1846, and Honorary Retired RA 1876. \nContributed illustrations to the Etching Club's 'Deserted Village', 'Songs of Shakespeare' and 'Etch'd Thoughts' (1841-4). Moved to Cranbrook, Kent, 1856; senior member of the Cranbrook Colony of painters. Died Cranbrook 23 September 1886; his studio sale was at Christie's 21 May 1887. \nLIT: Art Journal 1855, pp293-6, 1862, p138, 1866, pp40, 330, 1886 \npp351-2 (obit); Athenaeum 2 October 1886, p439 (obit); The Times 24 September 1886 (obit); DNB\nThe Lesson \n509-1882 Neg 52985 \nPanel, 38.1 X 58.3 cm (15 X 23 ins) \nSigned and dated (the date is indistinct) 'T Webster/1831' diagonally bl  \nJones Bequest 1882 \nThe background is similar to those in 'Goodnight' (Bristol Museum and Art Gallery) and 'Sunday Afternoon' (Wolverhampton Art Gallery).
