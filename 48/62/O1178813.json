The architect Philip Johnson (1906-2005) ironically did much to promote Modernism in the United States during his early career. He introduced such influential European architects as Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius to the country where their influence would shape 20th century American architecture. Yet, his later years are characterized by a move towards postmodern thinking. In conjunction with his colleague John Burgee (1933-) Johnson designed a classic skyscraper which has more in common with earlier Manhattan buildings like the Chrysler and the Empire State and less in common with New York's austere, postwar skyscrapers of concrete and glass such as the Seagram building (also designed by Johnson). However, the top of the AT&T building boasts an unorthodox addition which resembles a Georgian pediment in the style of a Chippendale bookcase or wardrobe. This apparent disrespect for historical and social context was seen as provocation on a grand scale and the skyscraper came to be the most controversial building of Johnson's illustrious career. Such irreverence is a key theme in postmodern design whether as a direct critique of modernism or as playfulness for the sake of wit.",
