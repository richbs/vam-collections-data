The central pendant also has a crescent-shaped plaque above the drop.  The front surface of all parts is decorated with a design of thick applied wire, which holds round cabochons of red and blue opaque glass, imitating coral and turquoise (most missing), and there is a raised boss in the centre of each of the seven central necklace plaques which formerly contained a paste.\n794F-1902 (broken part) is a pendant\n[Necklace] Necklace composed of sheet silver and wire decoration, inset with blue and red glass.
