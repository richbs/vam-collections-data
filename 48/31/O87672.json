It was recovered from an area we now call the Silk Road. This series of overland trade routes crossed Asia from China to Europe. The most notable item traded was silk but the Silk Road was also important for the exchange of ideas. While silk textiles travelled west from China, Buddhism travelled east, entering China from India. \n\nThe V&A has around 700 ancient and medieval textiles recovered by Stein at the beginning of the 20th century. He made several expeditions to the chain of abandoned oasis settlements in the Silk Road region and each time brought back a wide variety of material.  \n\nThe textiles range in date from the 2nd century BC to the 12th century AD.  Some are silk while others are made from the wool of a variety of different animals. Most of the pieces are fragmentary, as here, and it is not easy to see what they would originally have been used for. Occasionally, whole items survive such as shoes, purses and religious banners.",
