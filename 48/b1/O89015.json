Whitcombe Green in 1929.\n\nHistorical significance: This relief of the crucifixion is slightly convex, reflecting the shape of the mollusc shell. The background is recessed and gilt. The finely-carved and densely packed composition may well be based on an engraved source, perhaps by Master ES, although the exact print has not been traced. The relief is in a gilt mount, and was probably an independent devotional piece. Similar mother of pearl reliefs are in the collections of the Cleveland Museum of Art (CMA 68.240), the Stuttgart W\u00fcrtembergisches Landesmuseum, and Lucerne, Kofler-Truniger Collection.",

Often such works depicted religious subjects (though some portraits are also known), and were probably particularly valued because they could serve as portable devotional items. Engraved sources frequently provided the basis of the compositions, and the carvings were generally produced in anonymous workshops. The material was valued as much as the skill in carving. Some mother of pearl reliefs were attached to crucifixes, reliquaries, portable altars or rosaries, while others were later valued as Kunstkammer objects, and set into caskets and cabinets.",
