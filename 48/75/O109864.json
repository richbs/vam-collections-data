Salvin was commissioned to produce designs in 1826 and building was completed in 1838. The furniture, although designed in the style of the 1830s, incorporated Tudor details from the 1580s, such as bosses, pendants, incised decoration based on blackwork embroidery, and strapwork, where patterns were formed of twisted and interlaced bands. This table is decorated with circular bosses around the frieze, pendants hang from the corners of the top, and pierced strapwork panels, which fill the end supports. It is designed for writing, with a leather top, two drawers in the frieze, and a padded foot rest on the stretcher.\n\nOn loan to National Trust Knightshayes Court.",
