Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nIn the 20th century artists began to make works of art with 'found objects'. Jewellers followed this tradition, or even took it a step further, by recycling materials to make entirely new creations. With today's consciousness of global warming and the need to use sustainable materials the jeweller of the future will undoubtedly engage more with recyclables. \n\nThe Norwegian jeweller, Sigurd Bronger chose to integrate an everyday 'found object' to create a humorous parody. His aesthetic is formed by miniature engineering, whereby redundant mechanisms become part of the technical expression. His jewellery reflects on crossovers, between art and engineering, jewellery and sculpture. Wearability is not his concern, it is more about how jewellery is made, or possible themes and stories it can tell. By using common everyday objects, he questions the preciousness of jewellery, its' monetary values and purpose. Functional objects are thus turned into jewellery.",
