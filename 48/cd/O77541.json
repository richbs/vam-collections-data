In the case of this object, the cord or thong passed through the raised bosses, while the heavier bottom made it hang in a stable way. Other less practical contemporary flasks were shaped like miniature barrels.\n\nTrading\nUnexpectedly humble objects were often traded between distant countries. Thus while elaborately painted Italian maiolica was hardly imported into northern Europe, utilitarian country pottery that looked even vaguely exotic  sometimes found its way to Holland and England. These Italian flasks, probably from the Pisa area, are a good example.\n\nDesign & Designing\nFunctional water-carrying flasks were an essential accessory for a traveller of any social class. These might be cheap leather bladders, earthenware, wood or expensive metal. The form of the long-necked earthenware flask, with lion-mask bosses through which the carrying cord passed, was copied from expensive metalwork prototypes. But while the silver or brass versions were the grand objects shown in contemporary prints, used both for display and also for dispensing wine at feasts, these humble earthenware flasks were probably used by agricultural workers. The makers attempted to upgrade the flask with surface marbling by using the two colours of clay available to them.",
