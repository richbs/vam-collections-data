The individual components are laminated wood that was first boiled in glue and then moulded into curvilinear shapes. (Thonet patented this inventive new process in Prussia in 1840.) The result is a lightweight chair - this chair weighs 2.1 kg - with great tensile strength. It is also a cheaper method of production than joining together solid carved or turned wood parts. This chair is an early example of Thonet's work. The later 'bentwood' furniture - moulded from solid lengths of wood - made at his factory in Vienna was very successful from around 1850 onwards. Mass-produced furniture of the bentwood kind was primarily intended for restaurants, caf\u00e9s and hotels.",

These were sanded and joined, and veneers were applied to most surfaces to hide the striations of the veneers, giving the chair a more uniform surface appearance.  The result was a lightweight chair - this chair weighs 2.1 kg - possessing great tensile strength. Only a few similar examples are known. Thonet's 'Wienerst\u00fchle, which evolved from this chair, became widely famed.",

The side stretchers show one continuous curve starting and ending at the back, with the front to back curve cut to fit within this. The veneers on the front of surface of the top rail show wavy line joints, approximately 100mm apart. The caning show no sign of pegging and is all tied.  Veneer is blistered at the back of the seat.  Old tearing, which has been repaired, shows at the left of the top rail.",

The 1820s saw not only the importation of many technical methods and machines from England but the invention and patenting of scores of new woodworking machines. Thonet himself was to spend the 1840s perfecting methods for bending laminated and solid wood, and by the 1850s he was mass-producing 'bentwood' furniture made from solid wood manufactured in a modern factory using machinery designed and built by his own firm, Gebr\u00fcder Thonet (Thonet Brothers).",
