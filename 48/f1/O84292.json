The first one opened in 1955, on the King's Road in Chelsea, with the Knightsbridge 'Bazaar' opening a couple of years afterwards. In 1962, the window of the Knightsbridge shop was centred around this 'Tutti Frutti' suit. Previously considered conservative, grey flannel was enlivened with pie-crust frills and sharp cutting. This immediately prompted a trend for tailored frills, and fabric retailers were said to have run out of grey flannel. \n\nQuant's simple, easy-fit design was aimed towards active women like herself, who needed smart, comfortable work clothes. The cardigan-style jacket is trimmed with a piecrust frill and has no front fastening. The skirt has a kick pleat at the back and a zip at the hip. The white crepe blouse fastens with buttons at the back and has a bow at the neck.",
