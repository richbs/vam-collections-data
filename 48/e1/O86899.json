It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nBorn in Ireland, Peggy O'Neil was educated in Canada and made her first stage appearance as a child dancer at La Salle Opera House, Chicago, in The Sweetest Girl in Paris. She made her New York debut in 1917 and appeared in London in 1920 when she starred in the long-running success Paddy the Next Best Thing. She appeared in a variety of West End and touring productions, as well as in films including The Sleep of Cyma Roget (1920).  The first ever on-camera television interview was made with Peggy O'Neil in 1930, when she was filmed speaking from the Ideal Home exhibition in Southampton.",
