There are six designs for this ballet in the Cyril Beaumont collection.  The role of the Girl was created by Anne Heaton.\n\nHistorical significance: An example of a costume design by one of the leading dance designers of his period, who worked extensively with the emerging British ballet companies in the 1930s and 1940s.  Although not revolutionary in style or concept, Stevenson's work, in its sympathy with both the subject and mood of the works he designed, and the needs of the dancer, exemplifies the best in dance design at that time.",
