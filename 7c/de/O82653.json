            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 152, 154-155\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\nThe canvas has been relined.  A strip about 2 inches wide on the left is unfinished and was at one time doubled under the body of the sketch.\n\nThis has been known, while in the Museum, as \u2018Red Brick House on Hilly Road\u2019 (<i>Inventory of Art Objects 1888</i>, and subsequent catalogues).  Holmes, p. 243, dates c.1815 and describes as \u2018Houses and Trees, Hampstead?\u2019.  The Borough Librarian of Hampstead, however, confirms that the scene represented is at the Lower Terrace, Hampstead.  The corner house shown in the painting is No. 4 Lower Terrace, and it has since been remodelled or rebuilt as Fountains House.  A portion of the next door house, No. 3, is also to be seen on the left-hand side of the picture.  Constable lodged at No. 2 Lower Terrace in 1821 and 1822.\nIn a letter received in the Museum on 24 April 1888, Miss Isabel Constable wrote to Mr. R. Thompson (see p. 3 of the Introduction): \u201cThe House in the old fashioned garden is at Hampstead though it is not the Well Walk House, I am not quite sure but I think that it was called The Terrace\u2014Hampstead\u201d.  This sentence refers to a painting or drawing\u2014hitherto unidentified\u2014in Miss Isabel Constable\u2019s gift to the Museum.  Despite the implication that the house depicted was once lived in by Constable, No. 252 [584-1888] does not show in fact No. 2 Lower Terrace, she had not lived there subsequently.\nAmong Constable\u2019s exhibits at the Royal Academy in 1822 was a work described in the Royal Academy Catalogue, No. 295, as \u2018View from the Terrace, Hampstead\u2019 and by Leslie (L. ed. S., p. 130) as \u2018A View of the Terrace, Hampstead\u2019.  If Leslie\u2019s correction is justified, it is possible that No. 252 [584-1888] in this Catalogue may have been this painting or a sketch for it.  The criticism of the exhibited work in the periodical <i>Museum</i> as \u2018cold and raw\u2019 suggests, however, a more considerable and a different picture (Whitley, <i>Art in England</i>, 1821-1837, p. 29).  No. 252 [584-1888] was in any even probably painted when Constable was living in the Terrace that is in 1821 or 1822, and is placed here accordingly.\nFor a view taken from the window of No. 2 Lower Terrace see No. 402 [137-1888].",
