She is posed to illustrate the religious legend of St Agnes Eve, which tells of the evening that virgins dream of their future husbands. The sensuous quality and mood Julia Margaret Cameron created in her images was recognised despite criticism of her technique, most notably of a lack of sharp focus in her work. However, the effects were intentional, as she noted in Annals of my Glass House (1874): \u2018When focusing and coming to something which, to my eye, was very beautiful, I stopped there instead of screwing on the lens to the more definite focus which all other photographers insist upon.\u2019 Her exposure times of three to seven minutes compounded the soft focusing of her images because her subjects were likely to move during that time. Apart from portraiture, much of Cameron\u2019s work concentrated on allegorical or, as here, religious, themes. She used models who were often her servants to pose as figures from the Bible, poetry or classical mythology.",
