A sum of money, known as a premium, was usually paid to the master, and the master agreed to train the child in his profession, and supply them with appropriate lodging and food, for the duration of the apprenticeship.\n\nThis indenture was for Owen Aldridge, a 12 or 13 year old boy, who was signed over to be a blacksmith to Thomas Henry Harris for three years, in 1890. The contract occludes medicine, medical attendence and clothing from Harris's responsibilities to Owen, which were to remain the responsibility of his father. \n\nAfter serving his apprenticeship, Owen Aldridge came to live and work in Wandsworth, London, where he set up his own blacksmith's forge, which became a very successful business, employing eight men. Owen's son also became a blacksmith, but instead of being indentured, he studied to become a blacksmith at Wandsworth Polytechnic college.",

After opening his own forge in Wandsworth, his son, Thomas, trained to be a blacksmith at polytechnic college. The family were evacuated during World War II, to Surrey, where Thomas Aldridge worked at the local forge. Thomas Aldridge's son Robert bought a blacksmith forge in the 1970s  in Ascot, in order to keep to the family tradition going, but left in 1978 to become an engineer in Guildford. This indenture was given to the Museum by Brenda Aldridge, wife of Robert Aldridge.",
