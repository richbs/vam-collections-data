The rosettes change their colours from band to band while the stars can be in bands of white, green, and dark blue. Each band is framed above and below by pairs of white decorated serrated leaves that join to form the horizontal. Lying across these bands is 1 row and 2 half-rows of 2 and a partial third outlined in dark blue which are formed by 2 shield shapes joined by 2 vertical bars enclosing the white star (as above). These give a vertical element to the design. Each of the many framed areas has a network of small flowers on angular stems. Just below the central green star there is a pair of inward-facing yellow birds with one at either end (at top of shield).\nMain border: dark green ground with large elaborate rosettes divided by stiffly angled serrated leaves which, along the sides, have one half lying horizontally to the left or to the right. Around the rosettes are small animals, rosettes, and floral motifs. The small rosettes invade the guard stripes. Along the lower border and the field section of the top, the leaves are  paired to frame the blue rosettes.\nInner and outer border: yellow ground with a bold linked-chain design alternating in dark blue, dark green, and green: a barred reverse C-shape with a ring inserted to link each pair. Inside each reverse C is a simplified floral sprig in red",
