Tin toys cover a vast array of subject matters ranging from the space age to domestic objects. This monkey was made in England, possibly in the 1950s. The first tin toys appeared in the United States in the middle of the 19th century. The tin toy industry soon spread to Europe, particularly Germany, where many tin toys were made around Nuremberg. The three main manufacturers of tin toys based in the UK were Wells Brimtoy, Chad Valley and Mettoy. Many tin toys produced in the UK were considered crude or naive by the standards of those produced in Germany or Japan. \n\nThis monkey looks as though it could be part of a circus set, and the somersaulting monkey was not just produced in England, but also in France, India, Japan and China. All of these examples can be found in Michael Buhler's collection.",
