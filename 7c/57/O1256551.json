The cover, designed by John Wyatt, is mostly grey and black, with a geometric design in pink, red and white to represent the wooden blocks of the Colour-Factor set. The text throughout is large and written in a direct mode of address to the pupil. Diagrams in the book are printed in colour and are the same size as the wooden blocks, allowing the printed page to be used as a template.\nThe instructions in the book direct the child to match wooden blocks to outlines on the page, or to experiment with finding patterns. It introduces mathematical vocabulary such as 'plus' and 'equals' to describe the reationships between coloured blocks. Towards the end of the book, children are encouraged to internalise the operations: 'Think of a block of any colour. Can you think of some patterns for this block?'.",

Thompson wrote a range of books for pupils and teachers, expanding the Colour-Factor method and providing models for activities. This book, with its brightly coloured illustrations, simple instructions and large typeface, was intended to guide pupils through increasingly complex operations.",
