His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nIn 1953, the Dorchester Hotel, London asked Messel to design a suite of rooms he would like to live in himself.  The luxurious suite of rooms and penthouse became known as the \u2018Oliver Messel Suite\u2019.  The suite and penthouse were restored in 1981 and continue to be in demand.\n\nFor the sitting room, Messel mixed seventeenth and eighteenth century antique furniture with his own designs inspired by period style, including a carpet depicting Leda and the Swan.  Sekers, the silk manufacturer, produced floral chintz upholstery to his designs.   The double bedroom has luxuriant yellow silk wallpaper, and is hung with original costume designs for Messel\u2019s ballet Sleeping Beauty (1946).  Flamboyantly, the mirror-lined bathroom features a shell-shaped gold lavatory cover and fittings.   The fabrics were replaced by Fortuny fabrics during the 1981 restoration.",

The silk manufacturer Sekers supplied fabrics for the chintz upholestry designed by Messel and Luforma Ltd. of Castle Northwick made carpets to Messel\u2019s designs.  \nHe also designed an ornamental roof garden and fountain surmounted by Leda and the Swan for the penthouse suite.  In 1956 Messel returned to the Dorchester Hotel, creating interior designs for the Pavilion Room. The designs for this room were inspired by Messel\u2019s designs for <i>The Magic Flute</i> (1947).  The Oliver Messel Suite was restored in 1981 by the Dorchester Hotel; the original fabrics were replaced with Fortuny fabrics.\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: Messel's most well known interior design and his largest decorative commission in London.",
