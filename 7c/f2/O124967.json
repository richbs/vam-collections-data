            "bibliography": "Parkinson, R., Victoria and Albert Museum, <u>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</u>, London: HMSO, 1990, pp.23-24\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\"CHALON, Henry Bernard (or Barnard) (1770-1849)\n\nBorn 1770, son of a Dutch engraver and musician; there seems to be no relation with the landscape painter J J Chalon and his brother the portrait painter A E Chalon. Entered RA Schools, and exhibited there 199 works between 1792 and 1847, 28 at the BI 1807-49, and 21 at the SBA 1827-47. Mainly portraits of horses and dogs, influenced by George Stubbs in colouring, composition and interest in animal anatomy. Appointed Animal Painter to, successively, the Duchess of York, the Prince Regent, and William IV. According to Joseph Farington's <i>Diary</i>, was candidate for ARA 1811. Many of his works were published in mezzotint; published <i>Studies from Nature</i>, dealing with equine muscular systems with anatomical tables, <i>Passions of the Horse</i>, illustrated with lithographs 1837, and <i>Drawing Book of Animals and Birds of Every Description</i>, a primer in the art of soft-ground etching. After a severe accident in 1845 (an appeal for money was made in the <i>Art Journal</i> 1845, pp265, 285), he died 15 August 1849. Married sister of James Ward RA; their daughter Maria was a miniature painter. \n\nLIT: \tJ C Wood <i>A Dictionary of British Animal Painters</i> Leigh-on-Sea 1973 \n\n<b>The English Blood-Horse 'Fidget'</b> \n1127-1898 Neg HH3822 \nCanvas, 133.4 x 191.8 cm (52\u00bd x 75\u00bd ins) \nGiven by Surgeon-General Sir James Mouat Bt, VC, KCB 1898 \n\nAccording to the Departmental files, the subject of this picture was bred in Yorkshire, bought by the donor's father Colonel Sir James Mouat Bt for 1000 guineas, and taken to India where the horse created a great sensation - the Nawab of Bengal was so struck by the beauty of the animal that he paid \u00a310,000 for it. Chalon exhibited a portrait of the horse on two occasions: 'Fidget, a Famous Blood-horse, the Property of Major J Mouat' at the RA in 1811, and 'Portrait of a Famous Blood-horse, the Property of Colonel Sir James Mouat, Bart' at the RA in 1827. The two exhibits may well have been the same picture; on the other hand, it was not unusual for a great horse to be painted twice in its lifetime, first in its young prime as a three year old and then as a magnificent stud. But apart from the confusion over the two Chalon exhibits, the identity of the present 'Fidget' is far from clear. \n\nThe famous 'Fidget' was a bay bred by Richard 'Jockey' Vernon in 1783 and bought by the 3rd Duke of Bedford. He won the Jockey Club Stakes and went to stud at the Duke's seat at Woburn, siring in 1797 the only unnamed winner of the Derby Stakes, listed as 'the colt by Fidget' (see R Mortimer <i>The History of the Derby Stakes</i> 1973, p3l). Before the stud farm at Woburn was closed in 1804, the <i>Racing Calendar</i> of 1803, which advertised the services of top stallions at stud, listed 'Fidget', at 5gs and a half [that is \u00a35 77\u00bdp]. He has but few blood mares, from which are several good runners, and has got a better stock of hunters and road horses than any stallion in England'. The Vernon-Bedford horse called 'Fidget' is thus well documented. The subject of the present work, although endowed with the same name, is unlikely to be the same horse. Even 'the colt by Fidget', presumably born in about 1794 (winning the Derby in 1797), would have been 17 years old in 1811 (the date of Chalon's first RA 'Fidget' exhibit) and 33 in 1827 (the second RA picture). \n\nThe present work shows a vigorous stallion, with awaiting mares in the middle distance, in what could well be a Yorkshire landscape setting. It seems most probable that the fine horse 'Fidget' belonging to the Mouat family and depicted here was named after the Bedford horse, and indeed was descended from him or 'the colt'. Other evidence of a connection between the Bedford and Mouat horses called 'Fidget' is that the breeder, 'Jockey' Vernon, was a Yorkshire man (the Mouat 'Fidget' was bred in Yorkshire). The Bedford 'Fidget' does not appear in the recorded obituary lists of stallions (which implies that the horse had been exported, although, unfortunately, records of exported horses did not begin until 1805/6). \n\nBut though the identity of the stallion has thus not been completely established, the painting takes a distinguished place in the traditional genre of depictions of an excited horse going to stud in which l5th-centurv artists like Sawrey Gilpin, Charles Towne and especially George Garrard excelled. The present work may also be compared with Chalon's set of six lithographs entitled 'The Passions of the Horse' (impr in V&A collections, 28267.1-6), which was published between February and October 1827, the same year as the RA exhibit mentioned above.\n\nEXH: ?RA 1827 (355)\"",
