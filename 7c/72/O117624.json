Born into a Jewish family in Frankfurt, she initially pursued an academic career before moving to Paris in 1930 to concentrate on photography. \n\nThis photograph was taken when Bing was relatively new to the city and was completing magazine assignments. It shows the influence of Bing\u2019s contemporary, the photographer Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz, who was also living in Paris at that time and photographed the everyday. Perhaps also influenced by the Surrealist movement, Bing liked to remove objects from their context. This gave her subjects new characteristics - in this case these groups of chairs almost seem to be alive.",
