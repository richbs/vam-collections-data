Skill is needed in preparing wet clay to give it strength and ease of modelling, also to remove excess water and air before it is fired in a kiln. Firing fuses the clay particles and causes other structural changes that affect the colour and lead to shrinkage of about 10%. Comparatively few works in unfired clay survive because they are fragile and easily damaged. \n\nThis group is unfired but has been coated. It has been damaged, but it is unusual for such a large unfired object to survive at all. Hercules is wrestling with the giant Antaeus, whose strength flowed from the earth. He holds Antaeus aloft and is squeezing him to death.",
