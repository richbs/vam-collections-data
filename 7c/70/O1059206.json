Inscribed on the back in graphite; 14, and again on a label.  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Twentieth-century copper-gilt rim of plain strip, the convex glass fitted into a rebate; a plain brass backplate; the hanger of solid cast cosse de pois type, combined with flat wire spirals of four turns; packed out with a card printed: <i>... ECARY,/ ... d Goldsm ...</i> The back engraved: <i>The last Viscount Irwin.</i>  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Acquired by the Hon. F H A Wallop before 1927 , when it was placed on loan at the V&A until 1949; given in 1933 to Alan Evans, by whom bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A (see Appendix 3), There is some evidence in the MS guard book of the 1927 Wallop Loan, compiled mainly by Basil Long, that the miniature may once have been in the possession of L C Cary, the Master of Falkland, (1) who told A C Stokes in January 1934 that he formerly had a miniature like this, 'but in a different frame'. \n \n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p, 10. \n\nWallop and Long debated the attribution of this miniature, Wallop advancing it as an early Samuel Cooper, and Long countering with the tentative suggestion of S P Rosse; the final decision being 'style of S Cooper'. Graham Reynolds in 1949 gave his firm opinion that the portrait was by Cooper, and this view seems now certainly to be correct. Though the face has been retouched with zinc-white (this late restoration \nwould account for the fine stipple in the modelling of the features, which was not, as Long would have recognised, part of Cooper's technical repertory), the portrait seems basically consistent with Cooper's work of the mid- to late 1640s.  \n \nThe inscription on the case seems to date from the nineteenth century or later, but it may reflect a family tradition or reproduce an older version. According to Burke, (2) the viscountcy of Irvine became extinct on the death of Charles Ingram, 10th Viscount, in 1788. (The spelling, as in the Temple Newsam MSS is regularly Irwin, though Burke, Cokayne et al. use the form Irvine.)  \n \nThe wording of the phrase in the inscription, however, could imply that the sitter was the previous Viscount. In that case the obvious candidate would be the 1st Viscount Irvine, Henry Ingram, who was born about 1620 and died in August 1666, according to Cokayne. He would have been about the right age at the apparent date of the portrait. On the other hand, would the first in a sequence (even assuming the inscription to have been the work of the immediate successor) normally be called the last? A similar objection extends to the less likely candidature of the Hon. James Campbell (c.1611-1660) who was created Earl of Irvine in March 1642 in recognition of military service in Spain. He was the first and only one of his line, but he was not, of course, a viscount. \n\n1 According to Stokes (see Basil Long's note in the Wallop guard book), L C Cary had a portrait - oil on slate - exactly like the Cooper miniature, inscribed 'a member of the Meynell(?)-Ingram family\" and 'Old Stone'. Henry Stone (1616-1653) known as 'Old' Stone, was a distinguished copyist or multiplier, after Van Dyck. A full-scale version by him after a miniature by Cooper would be perfectly possible, though the use of slate as a support would be unusual. \n2 Burke 1831.\"",
