The frame of the prototype was made up from standard T-section and consisted of only two parts, each incorporating one front and one back leg. These two H-members were assembled to cross beneath the centre of the seat\u2026\u2019\n\nSale poster: Race Dining Chairs \u2018Originally introduced at the famous \u2018Britain Can Make It\u2019 Exhibition in 1946, this chair led the way in the use of aluminium alloy castings for furniture construction. The framework, die-cast to a new low pressure technique is of a strong and graceful construction which is virtually everlasting. The upholstered seat and backrest, curved to give support just where it is wanted, provide the efficiency but eliminate the coldness often associated with metal furniture. These Race chairs, specified by the leading architects and designers for most of their important furnishing schemes, are now freely available, on both the home and export markets\u2026.\u2019\n\nDescription of Craftsman from Hollis, R. 1970.
