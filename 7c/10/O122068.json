Warp ends twisted into an incomplete fringe 14 cms. remaining.  Upper: as lower with 13 cms. fringe.\n\nDESIGN: Field: red ground with 3 almost equal niches; each niche has been woven in white cotton instead of red wool towards the end.  At the lower end are 7 squat pots.  Out of the central one grows a blue stem with 15 blossoms filled with metallic thread.  The multi-coloured stems reaching up into the other 2 niches bear 15 predominantly blue smaller blossoms.  The 4 other pots have metallic stems with small metallic blossoms; each stem acting as a pillar to support the bases of the green silk spandrel area.  From these bases arose 3 rows of metallic paired leaves with white cotton ornaments.\n\nMain border: white woollen ground with (upper and lower) a band of blue carnations, 3 per stem separated by 3 joined triangles in dark brown and (sides) a long yellow stem with the same flowers and between each pair is a small Y-motif in dark brown.\n\nInner border: dark brown ground with white cotton zigzag from which grow blossoms in a variety of colours.\n\nOuter border: as inner but a red zigzag.",
