Responding to specific locations in the Museum, the architects explored themes such as study, work, play, performance and contemplation. Seven of the proposals were then selected for construction at full-scale.\n\nThese projects promoted an attitude to architecture where to 'dwell' meant something more than simply to find shelter. Each building invited the participation of the viewer. These immersive environments reawakened people's ability to inhabit architectural space on both a physical and an emotional level.\n\nThis proposal is modelled on dwellings directly behind the architects' studio in Mumbai. It examines the unauthorised architecture that constitutes over half the city's built landscape. Echoing the parasitic settlements that develop in 'in-between' spaces, the structure represents an architectural 'cast' of an existing sliver of dwelling space. The original dwelling is home to a family of eight and occupies a narrow corridor formed between a group of industrial buildings.",
