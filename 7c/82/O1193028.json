She graduated from Kingston University in 1991 (BA Hons Graphic Design) and did a MA in Communication Media at Manchester Metropolitan University where she graduated in 1992. She based herself in London where her unique appearance (6.5\" in Vivienne Westwood heels) and her striking sense of fashion and style attracted a great deal of attention. She posed for Jamie Hewlett's \"Tank Girl\", an aggressive, shaven-headed and gun-toting female comic book character, wearing much of her own customised and individualised clothing. She donated this outfit to the V&A as an example of her style.",
