The central applique design, divided into two horizontal panels, show courtly scenes with the figures richly dressed in sequined coats with pah-sos and hta-meins of simulated luntaya cloth. The subject is unknown but may illustrate one of the Jataka stories or may be taken from Burmese legend. \n\nThe upper panel has a leafy setting with rolling clouds, two kinnaras (half human/half bird mythological creatures) on a mountain top. On the left they are observed by a kneeling archer, three noblemen and their attendant armed with a dha (sword). On the right of the panel, the kinnaras are watched by an elephant rider armed with a spear, a dancing lady-in-waiting and an attendant armed with a sword. \n\nThe lower panel contains a wooded setting with an attendant holding an umbrella over a prince who bends over from his kneeling elephant,and waves to two young ladies with his handkerchief. This is watched by three gentlemen. To the right of the panel, within a pavilion decorated with umbrellas and cut glass pendants, a prince is sitting on a raised seat and is in conversation with a minister kneeling with clasped hands watched by an attendant.\n\nFive borders surround the central design. On the outer edge is a scroll design, next a continuous inter-lacing motif, then one of flowers and foliage. The innermost two borders mirror the two outer borders.\n\nBacked with dark red cotton and bound at the bottom with a broad navy wool border, with appliqu\u00e9 work in coloured felt, wool, cotton braids and sequins, and the figures and animals are partly painted.",

The costumes of the figures are depicted in the stylised tradition of Burmese theatre and relate to the fashions worn in the Mandalay Court of about 1880. \n\nBritain's control of Burma extended as the 19th century progressed, and the country was  annexed in 1885. The extravagant style of kalagas appealed to Burmese and Europeans alike and their popularity soared in the mid 19th century.",
