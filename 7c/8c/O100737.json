It would have been placed horizontally on top of his tomb. The design resembles a mihrab, and shows that the deceased was buried in accordance with Islamic law, with his head pointing towards the Ka\u2019bah.\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century works of art from tombs and other religious buildings were removed and traded on the art market in Iran. Lustre tilework was regarded as of exceptional quality and was particularly attractive to dealers and collectors. As a result, a good deal of it has ended up in museums in Iran and abroad. \n\nRobert Murdoch Smith bought these tiles for the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A) in Tehran in 1875. He paid \u00a350 for them, a relatively high price at the time, and this reflected their size and importance. The vendor was a private collector called Jules Richard, who was employed at the court of Nasir al-Din Shah. Richard had been active as a collector for over 30 years and had displayed many of his acquisitions in his Tehran home. The tombs of descendants of the Prophet, and even sites that descendants of the Prophet were thought to have visited, were refurbished in a grand manner after the Mongol occupation of Iran in the 1250s, but they usually had only local significance in later centuries. Their consequent poverty may explain why the tiles were sold off.",
