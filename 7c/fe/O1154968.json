This game's world is operated by a referee who sets up the situations which the players confront. The game is mainly an interaction between players who operate the characters, and a referee, who oversees the world in which these adventures occur.\n\nThe original form of this type of game is conducted through speech. In live action role-playing games players perform their characters' physical actions. Role playing games are fundamentally different from most other types of games in that they stress social interaction and collaboration, whereas most board games and card games emphasise competition.",
