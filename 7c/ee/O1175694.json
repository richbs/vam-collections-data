Plastic and cotton hat. \n\nThis outfit was brought together by Slam City Skates, a London skateboarder's speciality store established in 1986, using clothes from London skateboarders. In 1992-93, skateboard wear was at its \"phattest\", a term used to signify coolness and approbation. The clothes had to be as outsize as possible, and individually customised to the owner's personal preference. For example, the red T-shirt here was worn inside-out as the logo was no longer considered cool, and the \"phat pants\" have had their hems cut and frayed. It was displayed in the Street Style exhibition of 1993-94 as an example of Skater style.\n\n\nPurchased. Registered File number 1993/2198.",
