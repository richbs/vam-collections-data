He was brought up in the family\u2019s martial traditions and given nominal command of an expedition at the age of six. He succeeded his father in June 1839, but was caught up in plotting between different court factions. By October 1839 he was a virtual prisoner of Dhian Singh, his father\u2019s prime minister and a member of the Hindu Dogra family. Always frail in constitution, he was slowly poisoned, finalled dying on 5 November 1840.\n\nThis painting was formerly in the collection of Lord Auckland, Governor-General of India from 1836 to 1842.
