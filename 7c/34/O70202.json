It was one of many objects transferred to the South Kensington Museum on the closure of the Museum of Practical Geology, Jermyn Street, but its earlier history is not recorded.\n\nHistorical significance: Pottery was made in Siegburg from at least 1150, with exports including stoneware from the mid-13th century and a potters' guild from about 1400.  Most of the workshops were just outside the town walls.  It is not known which workshop produced this particular jug.  Except for the 1580s when wars caused some potters to move away, the Siegburg industry attained its techical and aesthetic peak between 1550 and 1632 when the town was destroyed by Swedes in the Thirty Years' War.\nThe local clay, dug from shallow pits, was fine and pure and required little added sand to temper it ready for firing to a high temperature to make stoneware.  Fuel was freely available from local forests.  The jug was thrown on a fast wheel then the handle was separately applied to the jug when leather-hard i.e. partially dried.  Undecorated funnel-necked drinking jugs were made in quantities and could be bought more cheaply than those on which extra time had been expended on decoration.",

This funnel-necked drinking jug (or Trichterhalskrug\" in German) would have been used for wine or small quantities of strong beer.  This plain type were quick to pot so were made in quantities, both for local sale and for export.  It is not easy to date this jug precisely as the style varied little between the late fifteenth century and early sixteenth century.",
