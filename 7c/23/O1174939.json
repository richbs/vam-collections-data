Made of nylon, it wasn't made to be worn, but rather to be held up outstretched in the audience so that the band could see your adoration. This fashion came from the British phenomenon of having a scarf in your supported team's colours, and holding it up on the football terraces.\n\nThe Glitter Band were a glam rock band, initially the backing band for Gary Glitter, until 1973 when they began releasing records of their own. They had seven top 20 hit singles in the UK in the mid 1970s, and three hit albums.",
