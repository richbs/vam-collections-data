The manner of depiction of the clouds, the ruyi band, the dragon\u2019s scales and its giraffe-shaped head is unique. The rim and shoulder are decorated with a scroll band and a lotus petal band, while the base features a band of simplified waves. Two protrusions on the rim indicate that the jar was originally covered with a lid. Staining is visible on the exterior, and the foot has sand spur marks. It is likely that the jar was made at a kiln in Sangnim-ri, Gwangju, in the early 17th century.",

At the shoulder is a band of wavy lines; at the foot a cloud pattern. On the neck is a pattern of wavy lines. In Korea, porcelains in a nearly translucent glaze and fired at high temperatures (approximately 1300 degrees Celsius) began to be made in the 15th century. Underglaze iron oxide was also used for creating designs on celadons ('celadons' are stonewares with a light bluish-greenish glaze) during the Koryo dynasty (918-1392), but it became especially popular in the 17th century.",
