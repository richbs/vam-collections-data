These glazed Fassi (from Fez) wares were made by professional male potters as decorative tableware for urban consumers. Their style may have been influenced by the appearance of Chinese porcelain, historically made available through Mediterranean trade. Another factor was the availability of increasingly pure cobalt blue imported from Europe from the 1850s onwards.\n\nBowls like this, called zlafa, are used for drinking water, milk and, especially, harira, a traditional soup. The bowls are particularly associated with the month of Ramadan, when they are used at sunset to break the fast. This bowl was donated to the Museum of Practical Geology by George Maw, founder of Maw & Co., a British manufacturer of ceramic tiles, and transferred to the V&A in 1901.",
