The Preuning family of potters based in Nuremburg is recorded as making high class pottery of this type, although there are no marked pieces known, and there are also other workshops associated with these wares.\n\nThis sophisticated type of decorated pottery is usually associated today with the name of the celebrated French potter Bernard Palissy.  Palissy is known to have travelled extensively throughout Germany and Italy investigating pottery techniques before his highly finished lead-glazed wares, often incorporating relief models of insects and amphibians, brought his work to the attention of the French court.  He established his famous workshops in Paris at the Louvre in 1563.",
