The Weld children were second cousins of Richard Whitmore, who Bernard Lens painted in 1718 (inv. no. P.13-1971). Lens also painted Katherine Whitmore in 1724 (inv. no. P.14-1971). The maiden name of the Whitmore children\u2019s grandmother was \u2018Weld\u2019, and this little boy is probably one of her nephew\u2019s children. This family relation is of interest because it sheds light on the way in which a miniature painter such as Lens worked in the early 18th century.\n\nLens was based in London, where he taught drawing and miniature painting. He was a member of the convivial \u2018Rose & Crown\u2019 club for artists. He sketched regularly at the artists\u2019 academy set up by the queen\u2019s principal painter, Sir Godfrey Kneller. Lens also travelled regularly through England. He restored and framed miniatures in old collections, painted copies for collectors, and visited family homes to paint miniature portraits of family groups. This was presumably with the recommendation of one family to another.",
