In form however, this triptych does not correspond with any type of object produced around 1500. The crude quality of the carving, peculiar physiognomies, misunderstood draperies and the actual form suggests that it dates from the mid 19th century when Schongauer's prints were becoming increasingly popular in line with the development of the Gothic revival.",

The crude quality of the carving, peculiar physiognomies, misunderstood draperies and the actual form suggests that it dates from the mid 19th century when Schongauer's prints were becoming increasingly popular in line with the development of the Gothic revival.",
