Despite the large numbers sold, few survived, owing to the nature of the material and the intended disposability of the pieces.

Design Award, 1968.\n\nDecorated with lettering in a variety of typefaces, including the fancy Victorian ones which were revived in the 1950s and 60s. This paper chair was an inexpensive but fashionable product, designed to be delivered flat for home assembly. A spotted pattern was also available. It won a Council of Industrial Design Award in 1968.\n\nHistorical significance: Won a Design Centre Award in 1968.\n\nAccording to 'Design' (May 1968, p.33), the earlier versions of the paper chairs were made in the USA, while Murdoch was still a student. Perspective Designs commissioned him to design a new range in 1967. These were manufactured by New Merton Board Mills for Perspective Designs. Perspective Designs was established by Philip Bidwell in 1966 to promote young British designers, with a particular focus on selling overseas.",

Over 76,000 pieces were sold in six months on 1967, retailing at less than \u00a31 each. Despite several awards, the potential for mass-production in the 1970s was never fully realised and the disposability of Pop furniture means few examples have survived.",
