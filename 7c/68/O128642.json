His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel essembled a reference collection of costumes and headdresses of diverse ethnic origin.  This headdress made from clusters of beads, sequins and ribbons is probably from this collection, and would have been used to inspire the construction and design of his headdresses for theatre commissions.",
