It was to have a profound influence on 20th century industrial design. \n\nWith the staggering inflation in Germany goldsmiths were turning to base metals. At the Bauhaus, meanwhile, the emphasis was on design and work processes rather than the value of the materials. \n\nJewellery by the Bauhaus industrial designer Naum Slutzky reflects this age of machine technology and the new Modernist movement. His pieces embody function and pure form without ornamentation, in a novel combination of brass with chromium plating.  \n\nNaum Slutzky was born in Russia and emigrated to Vienna, where he studied engineering and art. In 1919 he was asked to lead the workshop for metalwork in the Bauhaus where he became a master goldsmith in 1922, and stayed until 1924. After an interim period in Vienna and Berlin, he moved to Hamburg where he remained until he went into exile and came to England. He taught product design at the Royal College of Art, London and the College of Arts and Crafts, Birmingham.",

In 1919, he was appointed as a teacher at the Bauhaus in Weimar, in the department of product design. Bauhaus principles of applying industrial imagery to domestic areas of design underpinned Slutzky's work as a jeweller and also formed a link with some of the starker motifs of contemporary French Art Deco jewellers. From 1927, he worked as an industrial designer until 1933 when he fled from Nazi Germany. Although he worked in conventional materials such as gold and cabochon stones, he was also fascinated by the newly commercially available chromium plated brass. Slutzky settled in England where he had a successful and influential career in various colleges including Dartington Hall in Devon, the Royal College of Art and Birmingham's College of Art and Design. Although he made very little jewellery between the mid-1930s and 1960, the early 1960s were again highly productive years when he worked principally in silver decorated with enamel and pebbles.",
