The book was made to accompany a Brownie uniform she had made for one of her dolls called Amelia-Ann. Eleanor, along with her sister  Lucy were in the Brownies and Guides respectively, hand sewed outfits for their dolls to look like them in their uniforms.\nThe book and particularly the uniform have a great attention to detail, with hand embroidered skill badges including the hostess, the pony rider and the first aid badge that Eleanor herself had attained. The doll also 'belongs' to the same pack that Eleanor attended and is similarly one of The Gnomes, identifiable from the badge on her left arm.",
