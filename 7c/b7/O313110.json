            "public_access_description": "This ivory relief represents Anna Countess of Leven and is made by David Le Marchand in ca. 1700.\nAnna was the eldest daughter of Sir James Wemyss, Lord Burntisland (d. 1682), and Margaret, Countess of Wemyss (d. 1705), and sister of David, 3rd Earl of Wemyss. Her parents married in 1672 and she was the third of five children, so she was presumably born c. 1675. She married David, Earl of Leven on 3 September 1641.\nDavid Le Marchand (1674-1726) was famed for his ivory carvings, particularly his portraits. He was a native of Dieppe, France, and came from a Huguenot, or Protestant, family. With the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, and the consequent persecution of non-Catholics, he had to flee France. He was next recorded in Edinburgh in 1696, where he is documented as receiving official permission to open a shop and take on apprentices. He was in London by 1700, when he started to achieve a reputation for his portraits. Despite his wide circle of important patrons and  his evident success, Le Marchand apparently died in poverty, though the exact reasons for this are unknown. He is recognised as the most distinguished ivory carver to have worked in England in the early 18th century, a period when the art enjoyed a popularity unknown since the Middle Ages.",

Their relatively simple style in shallow relief, suggests that they may date from the beginning of Le Marchand's career in Edinburgh, after 1696.",
