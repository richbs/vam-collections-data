There are four lines of calligraphy reserved in white on yellow.  This panel is framed by a floral meander in blacking bearing blue and red flowers with blue leaves.  This border also frames the corner squares and a series of rectangles. The corner squares are red with a central black ground rosette with the inscription reserved in cream.  There is another rectangular panel across the top and bottom with a three line inscription in white on black with a rosette in the lower right hand corner.  The one across the top lacks the rosette.  Either side of these rectangles is a vertical panel containing two red and light blue flower heads on a purple ground.\nTwo pieces have been sewn together to form the length: there is a neat seam along the length of the cover between the cream central panel and the border.  The cotton fabric was joined together before it was printed. \nColours: red, light blue, light yellow, purple, black.\nThe printing is not particularly high quality.",
