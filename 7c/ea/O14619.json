            "public_access_description": "This bowl represents the modern aspect of the long-standing interest of the Japanese in Chinese ceramics. Its maker is the third generation of a distinguished family of potters who live and work near Tokyo and have long been known for their ceramics in Chinese styles. Since the early 1970s Shinobu has specialised in celadon wares, which have a green, blue or grey-green glaze. This is achieved by firing a glaze mixture containing a small proportion of iron oxide in a reducing atmosphere - one in which the kiln is starved of oxygen so that the burning fuel draws chemically bonded oxygen from the reactive parts of the ceramic material, leaving them in a reduced state and changing their colour. Shinobu draws much of his inspiration from Chinese Southern Song dynasty (1128-1279) celadons of the type traditionally admired in Japan. This bowl reflects the potter\u2019s departure from small and rather delicate shapes into larger and bolder forms. He has purposely used a smooth rather than a crackled glaze to add tension to a highly wrought shape, which draws its principal effect from two small cusps to the thin everted rim.",
