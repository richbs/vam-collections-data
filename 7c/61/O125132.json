Studied drawing with Samuel Prout and entered RA Schools 1809. Won silver medal of the Society of Arts 1810. Travelled to Paris 1815, and lived in Rome 1816-30. Exhibited 51 works at the RA between 1823 and 1855, and 18 at the BI 1813-40. Subjects principally classical, historical and biblical, but also later Italian genre subjects. Elected ARA 1827, RA 1830. Also pursued a distinguished administrative career, notably after election to PRA 1850, and his directorship of the NG 1855-65. Several publications, notably <i>Materials for the History of Oil-painting</i> (1847), and translations of German art treatises. Married the author Elizabeth Rigby 1849; died Pisa, Italy, 24 December 1865; his wife refused a public funeral for him in St Paul's Cathedral.\n \nLIT: <i>Art Journal 1855</i>, p277, 1865, p60 (obit); Lady Eastlake <i>A Memoir of Sir Charles Lock Eastlake</i>; 1870 W Monkhouse <i>Pictures by Sir Charles Lock Eastlake</i> 1875; D Robertson <i>Sir Charles Eastlake and the Victorian Art World</i> 1978 (with full bibliography) \n\n<b>An Italian Contadina and her Children</b> \nFA71 Neg L1861 \nCanvas, 46.3 x 36.8 cm (18\u00bc x 14\u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the BI in 1824 as 'An Italian Scene; a contadina and her children', the size given in the catalogue as '26 by 21 inches'. It is listed by Lady Eastlake as painted for John Sheepshanks in 1823. \n\nShe lists another, 'A Contadina and Children', painted for N G Phillips in 1825; that was exhibited at the RA in 1831, and engraved for the <i>Art Joumal</i> in 1867 (facing p244) by SS Smith (signed and dated 'CLE ROME 1826', in 1867 in the collection of Thomas Birchall of Preston). The engraving shows a different composition from the present work. \n\nThe <i>Art Journal</i> (1867, p244) commented that Eastlake's residence in Rome, between 1816 and 1830 \n\nFostered, if it did not actually create, that feeling for Italian Art - reproducing Italian scenes and customs - which so large a proportion of his works exhibits. In all, or most, of these one observes a grace and tenderness of expression, a quiet, subdued tone of colouring, and an absence of everything that would produce strong emotion or extort admiration. They are attractive and winning, not by an original conception, nor by vigour of treatment, nor by bold effects, but by unobtrusive graces that stand in the stead of these, and which may be summed up under the generic term 'refinement'. \n\nReviewing the Sheepshanks collection in 1857, the <i>Art Journal</i> found this and 'A Peasant Woman Fainting from the Bite of a Serpent' (FA 70, p75) 'distinguished by the vigour and colour which characterise all the Italian subjects by him'.\n \n<i>Contadina</i> is Italian for a peasant woman; here she seems to be wearing traditional costume, perhaps Roman in origin. \n\nEXH: Br 1824 (74); <i>British Art Fifty Years Ago</i> Whitechapel Art Gallery, Spring 1905 (71) \n\nENGR: J Mitchell, as 'The Contadina', for <i>The Literary Souvenir</i> 1827, p244, with accompanying verses \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1857, p240; <i>Lady Eastlake</i> p194; <i>Robertson</i>, pp256-7\"",
