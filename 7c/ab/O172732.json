For a press campaign for the whisky distillery Glenmorangie, the advertising agency commissioned wood engravings after market research undertaken by Gliddon & Gliddon found that the technique invoked notions of tradition and craftsmanship. The campaign focussed on the work and pastimes of the men who worked at the Glenmorangie Distillery, so artist George Tute (born 1933) was sent to meet the individuals who worked there. Examples from the series are at E.4041-1995 to E.4044-1995. A colour proof of this is at E.742-1994.",
