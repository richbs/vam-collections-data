The Museum holds many sets for children where they can play with toys that resemble the adult world, such as a kitchen set or a farmyard. The Hospital Set is another example of this type of play. Crescent Toys was a well-regarded British toy manufacturing company set up in 1922 by Henry Eagles and Arthur Schneider in Islington, north London. They manufactured high quality model soldiers, die cast metal sports cars and Grand Prix racing cars and various hollow cast figures.\n\nThe company was also particularly well known for making detailed dioramas such as this hospital set as well as a classroom and a variety of shops. They finally ceased trading in 1964, having not moved into plastic production.",
