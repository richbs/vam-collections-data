They are further strengthened, decorated and made functional by a short \"deck\" that is formed from two narrow 14 carat narrow gold strips that extend horizontally along and beyond the terminal base of the handle and provide a handle rest.  The peeled back edge strips are also reinforced and the whole handle decorated by a narrow billowing strut of 14 carat gold that extends from the centre of the blade and over the cap of the edge strips and all the way to the final deck.  The blade and handle strips have a delicate scratch finish, save for a contrasting polished stripe that extends from the tip of the blade to the base of the gold strut.",
