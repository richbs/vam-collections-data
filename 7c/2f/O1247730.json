At the outbreak of war imports from Germany were stopped.  There was also ill feeling towards buying German goods.  With the lack of items being imported the Government encouraged British potteries to produce china dolls along side their other goods and by 1915 many potteries were churning out dolls and children's tea sets.  \nThis doll was made by Hancock &amp; Sons of Stoke-on-Trent, which had been established in 1891.  They were commissioned by Hamley's toy shop to make a range of Fumsup or Kewpie type dolls.  This particular doll is called Lulu and she is a Red Cross mascot. She had a male partner called Wuwu a mascot for the Victoria Cross.  Many of the toys at this time were decorated with patriotic emblems or motifs, reflecting the country's mood.",
