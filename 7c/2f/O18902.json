Chinese merchants were allowed to maintain trading posts at Nagasaki, and inlaid cabinets like this were produced using Chinese motifs in their decoration. This cabinet was said to have been brought back from the Far East by George Burn, an officer in the Royal Navy. It may have belonged to Burn's father John, who was based in the Canton area of China in 1802.",
