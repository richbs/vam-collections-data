Mr. Gay was in all three plays, and the fact that tickets issued by him that evening (that would probably have been hand-written orders) would be admitted indicates that this was a Benefit evening for him, from which he would have received a percentage of the profits.\n\nThe paragraph of polemic against The Shrewsbury News,its proprietor Mr. Pidduck and its editor Mr. Neil, shows that the theatre's proprietor Henry Bennett had taken exception to some unflattering article or comment printed about the theatre. He lambasts the paper for its opinion and declares defiantly: 'that it will not in the least abate the zeal and perseverance of the Manager or his Performers in the attentive and faithful discharge of their arduous duty, always appreciated and rewarded by a generous and enlightened public, whose approbation and support is the only object of their ambition.'",
