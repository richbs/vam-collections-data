            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, pp. 225-26\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"PETHER, Sebastian (1 790-1844 ) \nBorn 1790, eldest son of the landscape painter Abraham Pether (1756-1812), with whom he trained, and brother of Henry. Specialised in moonlight scenes, also stormy and 'disaster' landscapes, working mainly for dealers and apparently little financial gain. Exhibited very few works: five at the RA between 1812 and 1826, two at the BI 1818 and 1831; three were rejected by the RA 1842. Genuine works seem to be rare, and they were much copied. Interested in science, he is supposed to have invented the stomach-pump. Died Battersea, London, 18 March 1844; a subscription for his large family was solicited by the Art Union. His eldest son William was an artist in mosaic. The Art Union obituary described his life as 'full of the most painful privations that any man ever endured'. \nLIT: Art Union 1844, pp144-5 (obit); Grant (OELP) \n\n\n\n\n\nWindsor Castle and Town by Moonlight (attributed to SEBASTIAN PETHER) \n415-1887 \nCanvas, 59.7 X 88.9 cm (23 \u00bd X 35 ins) Purchased 1887 \nAttributed to Abraham Pether in the 1907 catalogue, re-attributed to Sebastian Pether in 1957. A visitor had noticed in 1931 that the round tower of the castle has a turret that was not constructed until 1828; Abraham Pether died in 1812. Certain attribution seems impossible, however, in the light of the various versions of the composition by members of the Pether family, and the fact that their works are often understandably confused. \nAnother version of the present composition appeared at Sotheby's 23 November 1966 (101), Christie's 28 January 1977 (91), Sotheby's 12 March 1986 (97) and 11 March 1987 (100), and Christie's 15 April 1988 (69). Presumably the same painting, it is signed by Henry Pether. A composition slightly different in detail, bearing Sebastian Pether's signature but attributed in the catalogue to Henry, was at Christie's 22 April 1983 (31); a third, also given to Henry, was at Sotheby's 20 November 1985 (77). A version with a slightly different foreground is at Anglesey Abbey (National Trust), and a similar but closer view with a different foreground was at Sotheby's Parke Bernet 17 March 1982 (61) attributed to Sebastian Pether. \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
