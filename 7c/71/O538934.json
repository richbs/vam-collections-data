Stamps are central to her work and she has produced numerous decorative compositions in a philatelic format, including this work, entitled ' Official Stamp'. The print follows a traditional stamp format. It comprises a small sheet of stamps each repeating the same image and includes the perforations required to separate the stamps from each other and the selvedge that marks the edge of the sheet. However, in each case the images are somewhat subversive. Here, there is a glorification of  the athletic male figure in Olympian mode, raising his outstretched hand in a nationalistic salute, while the ribboned skull provides a sinister reminder of what failure to conform, and worship the state, can mean.",
