On turning the pages, each new reader is confronted with their own reflection, and forced into a world of self-contemplation and, potentially, self-knowledge. This was the first book object produced by Ron King and is one of only a small number of works with no text that he produced for his Circle Press. The original prototype for 'The Mirror Book/Book' was made for an exhibition held at the V&A in 1979 called, 'The Open and Closed Book'. The bookwork was placed on a lectern at the entrance to the exhibition and contained a couple of lines of text which implied that what you read mirrored what you were. For this later, editioned version the words were removed, the binding simplified and a black solander box padded with a blue velvet lining made for safe keeping.",
