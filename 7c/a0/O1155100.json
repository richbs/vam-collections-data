The cover image features a prop from the film The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, a collection of which were used for the cover of the album. The text reading \"Look Out it's the Rotten Bar Kid\" refers to a 1970s Rowntree's Milky Bar advert slogan, replacing Milky Bar Kid with Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols.\n\nJamie Reid's cut-and-paste aesthetic, as seen on this poster, developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, who would later become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
