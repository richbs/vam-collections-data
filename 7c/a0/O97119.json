They are embossed and chased with two episodes from the Sack of Rome in 1527 by the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, in his bid for domination of Europe. This plaque shows Pope Clement VII (Giulio de Medici) leaning out of the Castel Sant\u2019Angelo, where he was imprisoned, while imperial troops stand outside with their banners. Shields with the Medici palle (the family emblem) hang on the castle wall.\n\nIt is unclear how these decorated plaques might have been used but they must have formed part of a series of at least ten. The prominence given to the imperial troops in this plaque seems to suggest that the artist was depicting events from their point of view. The pictorial style, with its unbalanced perspective, and the flat relief of the busy chased details \u2013 for example in the waves of the Tiber and the clouds from the burning of Rome \u2013 suggest that the artist was from north of the Alps rather than from Italy.",
