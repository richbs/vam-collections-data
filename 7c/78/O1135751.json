The nursemaids are dancing with their arms around one another's waists, their heads turned away from each other and their plaits flying out, each waving a handkerchief in her free hand. They wear decorative full skirts, the right with pink roses; silver-grey and blue aprons and jackets of red and green. They also have necklaces of large round beads, and kokoshniks on their heads. To their right is a groom in hat, long waistcoat, peasant blouse, breeches and boots, his costume has patches of blue and silver. His right foot is extended, heel to the ground, his left arm is on his waist in a position suggestive of dance. The flesh of all the dancers is gold with highlights of silver or pink on the cheeks.

This production is set in the carnival atmosphere of a pre-Lenten fair in 19th century St. Petersburg. Valentine Gross woodcut-style drawings of nursemaids dancing with coachmen or grooms at the fair were worked up for use in souvenir programmes and publications.\n\nThe sketches are part of the Valentine Gross Archive (THM/165), held by the V&amp;A Department of Theatre and Performance. Valentine Gross Archive contains research material and artwork, including sketches, studies, drawings, pastels and illustrations. Only the artwork materials have been catalogued with museum numbers and given item level descriptions found in the Search the Collections webpage. \n\nValentine Gross, a.k.a. Valentine Hugo, was a French art student in Paris in the 1910s. She became a ballet enthusiast, illustrator, researcher and painter. Valentine Gross witnessed annual seasons of Diaghilev Ballets Russes in Paris and made preminary sketches during performances and rehearsals between 1909 and 1914.  She later worked them up into pencil or coloured drawings of various degrees of finish including illustrations and paintings.\n\nSome of the sketches feature in the book Nijinsky on Stage by Richard Buckle, published in London by Studio Vista in 1971.",
