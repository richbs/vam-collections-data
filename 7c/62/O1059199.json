Il, p. 33 (as <i>George Legge, 1st Baron Dartmouth</i> (b.1648), and dated 1656, but acknowledging the Museum's description as <i>Portrait of a Gentleman</i>), p. 163 (with correct date), p. 78, no. 532; Long 1930, p. 13 (as <i>A Gentleman</i>, probably a copy after Cooper, dated 1650(?)); Foskett 1974, p. 113 (as <i>Unknown Man</i> Signed <i>S.C.</i> and dated 1653); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 10. \n\nLong was the first to doubt the authenticity of this miniature ('very much like an eighteenth-century copy') (1) and to investigate the confusion over the sitter's identity. He read the date variously as 1653, 1652 and finally 1650, the figures evidently being then less easily legible than now, after cleaning. He pointed out that none of the holders of the barony of Dart mouth, (2) was either alive or adult at the assigned date of this portrait.  \n \nReynolds, on the other hand, took the view\" that the portrait was by Cooper, though the condition of the flesh-painting was bad and possibly retouched. This opinion is supported by recent examination; cleaning has disclosed some of the extent of the retouching and also revealed, under ultraviolet light, the striated pattern in the carnation ground that is frequently found in Cooper's work. The signature and date remain dubious: the writing is uncertain and apparently laboured, and the punctuation slightly unconventional. On costume and on style (if the portrait is accepted as basically by Cooper) a date in the 1660s would be plausible, and a date in the later 1660s would just about reopen the possibility of identifying the sitter as George Legge, 1st Baron Dartmouth, a youth in his late teens or early twenties. The original evidence for the Dartmouth identification is not recorded, but it might be thought surprising if Addington or a previous owner had simply invented the Dartmouth identification without taking the elementary step of seeing whether the title was a barony or an earldom. The Earl was William Legge (b.1672), son of the 1st Baron, created Viscount Lewisham and Earl of Dartmouth in 1711.  \n \nThe portraits of George Legge, 1 st Baron Dartmouth are:  \n \n1 Attributed to Riley, c.1690, Nationalmuseum, Stockholm. \n2 After Riley, c.1690, NPG. \n3 Unknown artist, in armour, c.1680, National Maritime Museum.   \n  \nThey are reasonably compatible with one another but are arguably too late to help with this miniature. Long pencilled in two other ideas:  \n \n1 That the miniature resembled in style a so-called MoH Davies by the monogrammist W p'4 Compare, however, the portraits signed with the cursive WP monogram (Cat. Nos 181 and 182). Long thought they might be by the same hand as the present miniature.  \n \n2 That the miniature was worth comparing with the portrait of General Charles Fleetwood (c.1620-1692) engraved by Houbraken after R Walker in 1740. In my view there is no Significant resemblance between the sitter for the miniature and this engraving, but the matter is complicated by the portrait now in the NPG.5 Foster's alternative identification (6) as Colonel George Fleetwood (b.c.1621), the Member of Parliament and Commissioner for the King's Trial, was adopted by David Piper (7) and, if the provenance referred to by Foster and Piper is right, there should be no doubt about the sitter's identity. However, the NPG image is only superficially similar to this miniature, and neither is convincingly comparable to the Houbraken/Walker subject. A General Charles Fleetwood, formerly in the collection of the Earl of Gosford and dated 1656 (8) is not by Cooper, and appears to have no authority as an image.  \n \n1 MS note in Museum files. \n2 According to Cokayne (1900-9), the first creation of 1675 was in favour of Charles FitzCharles (1657-1680); the creation was then extinct until the second creation of 1682 in favour of George Legge, b. 1647/8. \n3 MS note in Museum files, 1952. \n4 Buccleuch Collection; repro. Foskett 1972, vol. II, pl. 258. \n5 Loosely described as of General Fleetwood by Foster (1914--16, vol. I, pl. XL) but as the Swedish general and baron, George Fleetwood (1605-1667), by Foskett 1974, p. 109.\n6 Foster 1914-16, vol. II, p. 39, no. 250. \n7 Piper 1963, pp. 128-9. \n8 Foster 1914-16, vol.
