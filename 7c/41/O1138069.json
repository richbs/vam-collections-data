The first one, Star Wars: A New Hope (1977) became the most successful film in history and grossed over $290 million.  It was not only the film that became a success but also the mechanising that was produced alongside the film. The films captured the public's imagination and paved the way for the merchandising that accompanies many films today. A whole host of toy figures, spacecrafts and vehicles were available, as well as costumes, stationery, bedroom accessories and slippers.\n\nThis toy was produced by Hasbro for Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith released in 2005.  The description on the box states \"The Droid Tri-fighter is a weapon of the Trade Federation, which has aligned itself with the Separatist forces.  The droid is armed with laser missiles that contain buzz droids, which attach to enemy ships and tear them apart.\"",
