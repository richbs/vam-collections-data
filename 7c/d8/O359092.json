At each end is a border 11.5 inches deep, ending in a half inch of ribbed bands of green and white. The coloured border has all the pattern wefts carried across on the back, cut at the edges, sometimes as many as four at a time. An additional binding warp for this heavy border is carried on the back of the twilled centre.\n\nThe main border design is of short fat 'cones' defined by leaves and filled with flowers in pale blue, purple, green, yellow, tan, pink, and brown. The flowers are carefully shaded with these variations in colour. There is a narrow floral guard-stripe at the bottom, itself guarded by narrow bands of pink and black. Over another narrow pink and black band at the top of the border is a row of small roses projecting into the field. A short floss silk fringe is knotted into either end.",
