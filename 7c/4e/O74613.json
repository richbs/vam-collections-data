Veining and the use of fifteen subtly different colours (more than in any previous design) emphasise the vigour of the acanthus scrolls. A very similar conjunction of tiny background motif and scrolling leaves also appear in Morris\u2019s calligraphic and illuminated manuscripts. \n\nThe design in largely worked in watercolour and the printer would have had to interpret this in distemper \u2013 hence the colour notes on the front \u2013 including \u2018get Mr. Morris to paint in front leaves.\u2019 Notes on the back include \u2018The property of Mr. Morris 15/12/74.\u2019 \nAnother version of the design is in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. \n\n<i>Acanthus</i> was the first of a group of large-scale, heavily patterned and deep coloured paper: the others were <i>Pimpernel</i> (1876), <i>Wreath</i> (1876), <i>Rose</i> (1877) and <i>Chrysanthemum</i> (1877). The large size of this design requires thirty blocks to complete the pattern, making it an expensive paper costing 16s. a roll.'",
