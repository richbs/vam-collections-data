There is a selvedge down the left hand side.  The embroidery has been cut through along the right hand side. This is an unfinished piece.  There is a broad band at the bottom with diagonal stripes running from the lower right to the upper left, each with a small diaper pattern in a single colour. There are wider bands in red and in dark blue and narrow ones in pink. The pattern does not go across the entire width at the top of this border - it tapers in at the tip left hand side.\nThe pattern is a series of dark brown diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  \nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: no ground colour has been worked.  There is a small bud in red or dark blue on a dark brown stem with green leaves and a triangular base.\n[2] wider stripe in two designs: [a] red ground, sometimes in wool and sometimes in pink silk, with a stem, 2 bell-like flowers hanging down and one upright flowerhead.  Outlined in dark brown with some dark green and some light green leaves.  This sprig alternates direction. [b] dark blue ground with a large blossom partially worked in red and light green.  Triangular base and 2 buds at the top.\nThreads: Wool: red, dark blue, pink, dark brown; Z-spun. Silk: light green and pink; 2S",
