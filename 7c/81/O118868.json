The 19th century saw a craze for ceramic figurines of performers and Agatha Walker attempted to revive this tradition with her limited edition sculptures, modelled from life in plaster and coated with a fine layer of wax which was then coloured.  In 1931 Agatha Walker's wax figures were exhibited at the Fine Art Society.\n\nRobert Loraine was a successful stage actor for over 30 years and also a renowned aviator who made the first flight across the Irish Sea in 1910.  He was a Royal Flying Corps fighter pilot in World War I and began acting after his distinguished military career. This shows him as Mirabel in The Way of The World which opened at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith on 7 February 1924, with Edith Evans as Millamant and elegant designs by Doris Zinkeisen. This was another success for Sir Nigel Playfair.  He purchased the lease of the derelict Lyric Theatre in 1918 and transformed it into a highly successful venue, putting Hammersmith firmly on the theatrical map.",
