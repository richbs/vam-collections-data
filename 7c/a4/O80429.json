The mount is 40 x40cm. Drawing is signed and dated on the back Hefuna 1999.  \n\nOverall the image is like an asymmetrical window with six 'apertures' - two small at the top, two large in centre, and two very small at the bottom.

These drawings are inspired by the mashrabiyas or wooden fretwork screens placed in the windows of  Arab houses. They allow the person inside the house, usually a woman, to look out, while those outside are unable to see in. \n\nThe notion of gendered space, which has been emphasised by the artist, is examined by presenting the drawings over two layers: the one below is blurred and appears 'veiled', but at the same time, in terms of space and form, closely connected to the drawing clearly visible on the layer above. The screened window is also used to place ceramic storage pots to cool the contents and the design of some of these mashrabiya drawings (of which there are several) reflects this use of the space.\n\nThere are two related drawings in the Collection: E.838 amd E.839-2002",
