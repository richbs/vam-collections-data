It may originally have been a section of wall panelling.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe door is made up of six painted and two oak panels, decorated with greenish-gold vases of flowers. The frames are decorated with red and greenish-gold wood graining.\n\nPlace\nThe door was found in about 1900 under the staircase of Hyde Abbey House, Winchester, Hampshire, and is thought to have come originally from Hyde House, situated  nearby and demolished in about 1769.\n\nDesign\nThe decoration may derive from designs by Cornelius Bos (1510-1556),  who published a number of engravings of moresques and strapwork ornament in Antwerp and other Netherlandish cities between 1545 and 1554.",

He had travelled to Rome and produced engravings of the famous loggias in the Vatican painted by Raphael (1483-1520) and his workshop. Six of the panels are decorated with vases of flowers, cupids and fantasy figures, as were the panels in the Vatican.\n\nPainted Oak panelling (door) donated by Philip O King\n\nNotes from R.P. 4612\n\n21 September 1937 letter, Adams-Acton to R Edwards\nreports on an oak door \"probably Elizabethan in date\" overlaid with a red lacquer \"upon which was painted most interesting gold arabesques\".  The door had since been painted brown and a few panels only stripped by the dealer.  Acton persuaded the dealer to donate it to the V & A and writes to Edwards now to point out its importance in bearing out the theory \"that many of these rooms were painted and decorated\".\n\n25 September 1937 letter, Philip O King to Edwards\noffering a piece of painted oak panelling to the Museum.  He discovered the panelling in Hyde Abbey House, Winchester \"some time ago\".  He describes it\n\n\u2026 about 6ft high x 2ft wide and consists of 8 panels 6 of which I found to be painted in bright red, yellow & black.  Each frame has a different design on it and the woodwork between is painted in imitation of pine graining in red and yellow.\n\nKing had removed several layers of paint to reveal the earlier painted work.\n\n14 October 1937 Edwards Minute paper\ndescribes this as \"an extremely interesting specimen of Jacobean painted decoration\".  He has never seen anything comparable and notes that it is in \"very good decoration\" and will be a valuable addition to the collections.",
