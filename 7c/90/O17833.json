He wanted to give paintings in watercolour the same status that was given to paintings in oil. Turner made a sketching tour of the north of England in 1797. This watercolour is based on a drawing in a sketchbook dating from his visit to Warkworth. The castle was built between the 12 th and 15th centuries on a curve of the River Coquet.",

The watercolour was later engraved for the series The Rivers of England.  As expressed in the poem, it is the dramatically shifting atmosphere of the scene, combined with the rugged grandeur of the castle on its eminence,  that appealed to Turner.  It is exactly the kind of work that could withstand comparison with oil paintings on the Royal Academy walls.",
