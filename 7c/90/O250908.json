The ceremony took place at the Brompton Oratory, London, following a whirlwind three-week romance. The ceremony was covered by Hello! magazine.\n\nThe bride's choice of gown proved controversial. It was designed by Bruce Oldfield, a British couturier known for his dramatic and glamorous designs. The dress, in clinging white cr\u00eape, has a low neckline and cutaway sides, and apart from a bra style fastening, is backless. It reportedly cost \u00a33,000. The bridegroom took an instant dislike to it, considering it inappropriately sexy and revealing. In interviews he later said it was \"more suited to the catwalk than a church aisle\" and \"I think a woman should dress for the man she is marrying only, and her choice was wrong for the occasion. It was sexy for the world but not for me, and I told her so.\"\n\nThe marriage lasted four months. After the divorce, Lisa donated her wedding dress to a charity raffle to benefit ChildLine, where it was won by a relative of the donor.",
