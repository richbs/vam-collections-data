            "physical_description": "Silk cr\u00eape evening dress in a vibrant multicoloured floral print. Wrap effect bodice with caped shoulders and side tie at the waistband, and the skirt ankle-length. Edges of the bodice and skirt have been cut to follow the lines of the floral print and hemstitched. Printed with a freely drawn all over design of flower heads. They are outlined and detailed in fine black lines and printed  in bright colours - pink, orange, yellow, red, blue and green. The dress is sleeveless but the cross over panels which form the bodice fall over the shoulders. The waist is slightly higher than normal and a belt is attached to the back and ties at the left front. The long bias cut skirt is cut to cling to the torso but starts to flare below the calf. This fullness is achieved by the insertion of 5 triangular godets - two at the front and three at the back. The dress has two side seams and fastens at the left bodice seam with hooks and eyes and small press studs. One of the most interesting features of the dress is the hem and bodice edges - they are cut in an irregular manner around the flower heads and then minutely turned by hand. The seams are hand finished.\n\nThe bodice shows signs of slight alteration. The cross over panels are attached to the inner dress which has lost its straps. It appears that the top has been let out (lines of stitch holes are visible at the darts and seams) and this meant that the cross over bodice has also been adjusted during these alterations.",
