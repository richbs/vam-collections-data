            "public_access_description": "Tom Phillips employs a variety of media, and often addresses himself to the working out of an idea in visual form in sequences and series. He has said \"My passions are for structures, connections, correspondence, and systems which link the sensual, visual and intellectual worlds.\" This statement is particularly pertinent to this piece, which uses maps and the personal associations that come from a sense of place. \n\nPhillips has made a number of works which explore his connections to and daily experience of Camberwell and Peckham, the areas where he lives and works. Map Walks Nos. 1 and 2 are plans of a walking project using two different sets of media. In the first map he has used acrylic paint on pages from an A-Z guide. He has darkened and blurred the area around the route picked out in yellow; this is intended to indicate a walk at night with yellow standing for the fluorescent sodium street lighting. On the second map, a photograph of the same pages of the A-Z has been worked over with sepia oil paint and two separate routes picked out. They overlap with, but do not replicate the route on the first map. The meaning is ambiguous; these may simply be records of walks undertaken by Phillips himself, or he may be offering us the opportunity to follow in his footsteps, and to experience something of his locality, his influences and his inspiration.",

His work encompasses many types of media, including painting, printmaking, music and writing, any or all of which may be used in a single work or project. His works always embody a central idea, or are the working-out of an idea, whose origin often lies in some everyday object or occurrence that the artist has noticed and whose context and implications he explores in the work. 'My passions are for structures, connections, correspondence, and systems which link the sensual, visual and intellectual worlds' (Tom Phillips. Works. Texts. To 1974. p.17). His work is in effect an invitation to explore with him the underlying structures and correspondences that he perceives in the world. \n\n<i>Map Walks Nos.1 and 2</i> is one of many projects in which he explores the structures and correspondences that he finds in the area of London in which he lives and works, Camberwell and Peckham. One project, <i>20 sites n years</i>, involves the annual photographing of twenty fixed sites on a half-mile radius from his home. This project is to be carried on by his children, and his children's children, into infinity - the 'n' years of the title. Another project, <i>The Walk to the Studio</i>, involves the study of the minutaie of material that lie in the short walk between his home and his studio. In these projects he draws our attention to minute changes in the town scenery, such as new traffic-signs or paving, or the sweet-wrappers lying in the street, things that might otherwise go unobserved, but for him have a history and significance of their own. \n\n<i>Map Walks Nos.1 and 2</i> are plans of a walking project in the area studied through two different sets of media. In this project 'a street walk is aerially designed to be elegant in itself. Sometimes sitting in an aeroplane one sees a street 'picked-out' because its lighting has (or has not) been modernized (ibid, p.126).' In the first map he has used the modern medium of acrylic paint on the actual pages of an A-Z of London to pick out those streets worthy of investigation. The background has deliberately been darkened and blurred to suggest the darkness of night, and the route indicated with brilliant cream paint to suggest the fluorescence of the sodium lamps in the street. On the second he has returned to the traditional medium of oil-paint but this time traces different, disconnected routes around the two areas of Peckham and Camberwell on a photograph of those same pages. He implies that there are innumerable possible walks contained in the map, and innumerable ways of recording them. He is inviting the spectator to try out these walks, and perhaps create some of his own. In this respect, the work of art is no longer the object that the museum possesses; what it owns is the framework for some active thought or participation by the spectator which is in itself the work of art.\n\nHoward Coutts\"",
