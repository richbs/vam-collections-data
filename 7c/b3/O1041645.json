London: Published by Trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1987.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"Joseph COLLYER (1748-1827) after William CHARRON and John BACON (1740-1799).\nThe Front of Admiral Keppel's Freedom Box, 1779.\n<i>THE FRONT/ W. Charron exct./ J. Collyer sc./ London: Publish'd as the Act directs, 11 Decr. 1779</i> and <i>She fills the mind with nothing but the truth./ Thine honour, name and praise shall ever live.\n</i>12.5 X 18.5cm\nEtching and engraving coloured by hand.\nE.102-1986\n\nLit. Timothy Clifford, John Bacon and the Manufacturers in <i>Apollo </i>CXXII, p.288-304, Oct 1985.\n\nThis print is one of a set of five recording the appearance of a box, now in the Museum of London, in which Admiral Keppel (1725-1786) received the freedom of the City of London.  The prints reproduce the box actual size. \nAdmiral Keppel had been in command of the Channel Fleet at the Battle of Ushant in 1778.  His conduct there was called into question at a court martial, instigated by his second-in-command and held the following year.  He was honourably acquitted of the charges against him on the 11th February 1779.  The result of the court martial was seen as reaffirming the patriotism of the Whig opposition with whom Keppel identified.  The case roused great public feeling and Keppel was hailed as a national hero.\nThe box itself is of heart of oak mounted in chased and engraved gold trellis into which are set enamel medallions showing allegorical subjects.  Documents in the Corporation of London Record Office<sup>1</sup> detail the agreement whereby John Newman, a goldsmith, undertook to bear the profit or loss for the manufacture of the box and for the publication of the prints with Charron.  It was exceptional that this date for the design of a piece of metalwork to be published in prints simultaneously with its manufacture, but the practice became frequent with presentation silver in the early nineteenth century.  The prints and the box together commemorate a symbolic political act.  Other responses to Keppel's acquittal included hasty arrangements by Reynolds regarding the mezzotinting of one of his portraits of Keppel<sup>2</sup>, the renaming of public houses, bonfires and acts of public disorder against the Admiralty. \nAlso preserved in the Museum of London is a volume of prints of the box together with <i>An Advertisement, A Succinct Account of the Public Services of Admiral Keppel</i> and <i>A List of Subscribers</i> (whose orders totalled 345 sets) in a leather binding stamped with the same shell and anchor border that appears on the box.  In this volume each print is found in four states; printed in black, printed in red, hand-coloured with watercolour, gouache and a pigment that looks like gold.\nExamination of this print by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy has shown that the straps of the trellis work and the anchor and shell border are coloured with real gold. \nThe title page of an uncoloured set of prints in the V&amp;A,<sup>4</sup> gives the prices of prints as 'plain 7.6 Colour'd from 10 6d to L.2.2', this sliding scale presumably corresponding  to the different types of hand-colouring available. \nTwo different techniques have been widely used to apply gold to this print.<sup>5  </sup>The inscriptions around the edges of the medallions are done in powdered gold bound with some medium such as gum arabic or white of egg, whilst the gold trellis, anchors and tips of the shells are gold leaf.  The variation between the granular surface of the gold powder and the smoother, shinier, more reflective gold leaf can be seen through a magnifying glass.  The colourist (or illuminator one should perhaps say), would have had to apply a layer of liquid size or mordant, precisely on those parts of the print to which he wished the gold leaf to stick.  The shells in the border across the top of the print seem to be coloured up with watercolour, gold leaf and possibly also powdered silver (although silver may have been present in gold leaf of less than 24 carats), which may have become tarnished in the two centuries since it was applied.\nThe combination of hand-colouring techniques present in this print may result from an attempt on the part of the colourist to find the best means of conveying the appearance of a highly worked box made from a number of contrasting materials. \n\n\n1.

This box was presented with the Freedom of the City of London to Admiral Augustus Keppel after his acquittal at a court martial in 1779. At the start of the Amercian War of Independence, Keppel was put in charge of the Channel Fleet but found it unprepared for action. In July 1778, he led the fleet into battle against the French off Ushant, an island at the north-west tip of France. The action proved indecisive but his second-in-command, Sir Hugh Palliser, failed to support him during the battle. This led to a quarrel that resulted in Keppel's trial at Portsmouth. The case was politically charged as Keppel was a Whig and Palliser a Tory. Keppel was acquitted, he became a popular hero. When the news of the outcome of the trial reached London, crowds gathered in the streets to celebrate the result. They attacked Palliser's house and burnt him in effigy.",
