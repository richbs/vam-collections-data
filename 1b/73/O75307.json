He began practising photography in 1849 according to the technique patented in 1841 by the British inventor W. H. Fox Talbot (1800-1877). Turner's photographs were 'contact' printed from paper negatives (known as calotypes) of the same size as the print. He printed them on albumen paper, which is paper that has been floated on an emulsion of egg white containing light-sensitive silver salts. Between 1852 and 1854 Turner compiled 60 of his own photographs, including this one, in what is believed to be a unique album, 'Photographic Views from Nature'. It might have been a sample book, a convenient method for presenting photographs for personal pleasure, and for showing to colleagues or potential exhibitors. It remained in the Turner family until it was bought by the Museum.\n\nEashing Bridge is a medieval double bridge spanning the River Wey. It is the best of a series of bridges between the towns of Farnham and Guildford, which were probably built by the monks of nearby Waverley Abbey in the 13th century. Although the bridge itself was of great historic interest, Turner seems to have been equally absorbed in the intricate pattern of the trees.",
