Series of silver plaques often with a related theme, such as scenes from the life of Christ, were commonly used by goldsmiths to decorate the surfaces of larger church objects. \n\nThe plaque is one of three from the same source. The others depict St John and the descent of Christ into hell after his death. They were possibly made by Enrique de Arfe, one of the most successful Renaissance goldsmiths in Spain, or by a goldsmith associated with his workshop. De Arfe trained in Cologne in Germany but spent much of his career on commissions for monumental church silver in Spanish cathedrals.\n\nFor the other plaques in this series, see M.510:21-1956 and M.510:22-1956.",

They were mounted upon an ebonised casket, plaques 1-12 being fitted into niches round the sides, the remainder decorating the lid. The casket was further adorned with pierced silver strips and plaques in the Renaissance style and was supported on 4 feet in the form of double-bodoed lions holding sceptres.\u2019 \n\nThe casket was found to be modern when examined on acquisition by the Museum. \u2018... The composition of plaques 1-20 was not quite the same as that of 21-23 but all were of old silver... it was concluded that they were probably made in about 1530 by an artist working under the German influence in Spain. The possibility that they were German was discarded since nothing similar appears to be known in that country ... The nearest parallels were found to be the plaques decorating the hexagonal base of the Custodia by Enrique de Arfe at Cordova Cathedral.\n\nThe plaques 21-23 (fourth and fifth series) depicting the Virgin and St. John and the Descent into Hell, which all have flat backs, appear more appropriate for a processional cross. In this connection it is worth noting that Cordova Cathedral owns a processional cross by Enrique de Arfe as well as a Custodia.\n\n... The conclusions are that the plaques are part of a Custodia and of a processional cross and because of the incompleteness of their iconographical schemes, there must have been more of them and that they probably derive from the same Spanish treasury and were mounted up by an ingenious dealer for a rich client in the second half of the last [19th] century.\u2019",

            "historical_context_note": "The Spanish Church\nThe Catholic church dominated public and private life in Spain. Money and labour were lavished on religious art and images played a central role in daily worship. To ensure that goldsmiths focused on work for the crown and the church, the authorities brought in a series of sumptuary laws that limited the secular display of gems and precious metals. \n\nBy 1550 the silver mines in Peru and Mexico were generating enormous wealth for Spain and feeding the traditional taste for massive silver forms. They included the custodia, a towering architectural canopy that was unique to Spain. It was paraded through parishes during the Corpus Christi festival to display the Sacred Host (consecrated bread). The custodia embodied many characteristics of Spanish church plate. It was sculptural, highly visible and richly imaginative in design. \n\nWith the Counter Reformation, Spain became a triumphant defender of a revitalised Catholic faith. Silver altar vessels and entire altars, processional crosses, custodias and sanctuary lamps frequently appeared in goldsmiths' contracts.",
