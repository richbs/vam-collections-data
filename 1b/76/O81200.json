            "physical_description": "Rectangular <i>cassone</i>, decorated with a wedding scene in gilt modeled gesso and partly covered with red, blue and green glazes. The lid is flat, partly painted with black spots on an off-white background, and heavily worm-eaten. The back is decorated in the same way as the lid, the sides with a crimson \u2018artichoke\u2019 textile pattern, and the front with a wedding scene. The plinth is made up of three planks, forming the front and sides, and with a triangular bracket in each corner at the rear, forming the back feet. The sides of the plinth are decorated with a continuation of the textile pattern, and the front with two elongated quatrefoil frames, each containing two painted angels converging and holding an unidentified coat of arms. The upper part of the front is made up of figures, modeled in gesso, punched and gilded with red and dark blue glazes, similar to those on a <i>cassone</I> panel (Museum No. 21- 1869), which could well have formed its pair. \n\nThe wedding scene itself consists of two processions, the one on the left taking up two thirds of the picture, converging either side of a lute-player: the one on the left is led by a harper, and the one on the right by the bride, who is followed by five women, three of which form a group, holding hands in a dance, at the back. Male attendants in the left-hand procession hold  knotted handkerchiefs, which presumably have bridal connotations. The ground they stand on is decorated with stylized irises with red glazed petals and green glazed shoots.  The bridegroom\u2019s attendants wear a livery emblazoned with a leopard chained to a cushion on their cloaks, and the the bride\u2019s mother (or nurse?) has large dragon on a turf  emblazoned on hers. The families remain unidentified. Their headdresses would have been the latest Burgundian fashion, and very much in vogue in Florence between about 1425 and 1450. The bride is bare headed and wears a long plait, the sign of maidenhood. \n\nThe plinth is made up of three planks overlapping at the front and sides, chamfered at the top and nailed to each other in the front corners. Immediately below the chamfering runs a narrow, grooved fillet, which gives the moulding an overhanging appearance. An identical fillet is nailed to the immediately below the lid. The floor of the <i>cassone</i>, mainly made up of one board, is nailed to the sides and front at the edges, and a narrow strip of the same wood, which fills the gap in the floor, is nailed to the back. The front, back and sides of the <i>cassone</i> are four boards joined together at the corners with dovetails cut into the sides. (Note that both the chest and stand, which appear to be joined, the chest not intended to be lifted from the stand - are dovetailed to hold the front and back in place, drawer-style, not in the usual manner of chests to hold the ends in place.)  The corners are covered with canvas, and the front edges with a band of decorative gilt gesso punch marks. The lid is made up of two planks of poplar, with 19th century rails of walnut nailed to the front and side edges for extra support, and reinforced on the inside with three wooden slats, also added later. A bare, rectangular patch in the centre of the lid suggests that there was once a piece of moulding glued to the top. \n\nThe dove-tail joinery of the front and sides of the main part of the <i>cassone's</i> is decorated from top to bottom with punch marks, consistent with those found on the clothes of figures on the front panel. This indicates that the sides, although of different decoration, do form part of the original <i>cassone</i>. The lock is off centre and must have been crudely inserted at a later date. However, this <i>cassone</i> is considered largely authentic and to date from about 1430.\n\nConserved 2007\nIn addition to surface treatments, two nailed vertical battens (applied in the 19th or 20th century) were removed from the back, one at each end where they appear to have been intended to provide extra stability between chest and stand. In addition to the extensive removal of surface dirt, the painted stand, ends and back of the cassone were retouched. The front panel of the cassone was not retouched.",

A number of figures on this example wear Burgundian fashions, which were much in vogue in Florence between about 1425 and 1450.  Early records do not tell us where this cassone came from, but it was bought by this museum for \u00a340 in 1863, possibly from William Blundell Spence, a flamboyant English dealer based in Fiesole (just outside Florence), or from Giuseppe Baslini, a dealer from Milan, who in 1869 sold this museum the front panel  (Museum No. 21 - 1869) of  what could once have been its pair. This item is a rare example of a surviving cassone that almost certainly retains its original base, as well as remaining largely unaltered.",

This cassone could have been bought from either Baslini or William Blundel Spence, based in Fiesole.\n\nHistorical significance: During the 19th century, most cassoni are altered particularly at the base, or stripped of their front panel. This object is rare because it seems to have had few alterations and seems remarkably intact.",

Although often associated with containing the bridal trusseau, both the bride's and the groom's families ordered them, and on occasions they were paraded through the streets, as the bride progressed to her new home.",
