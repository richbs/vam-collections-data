There are scarfed joints in bottom of the drawers. The drawer back, sides and bottom are most likely ash. The front appears to be oak with applied carving.The lock is a later fitting (the lining paper stops short of the lock and the lock itself is open sided. In assessing if the lining paper is original or not, it covers the hinges so is no older than the hinges and appears to be earlier than the nail holes. The hinges do not look very old and on the outside one of the screw heads is covered with filler. The back board is recessed at the top to recieve each hinge. The front and side flutted friezes, moulding around the rising top and some of the mouldings below and at the side are walnut. The top horizontally grained section at the back is oak, the lower three verticaly grained are walnut, indicating that this was replaced. The top and middle boards have pronounced saw marks whilst the left hand board has less pronounced saw marks with overlaying curved saw marks. These boards are fixed into place tongue and groove and all three lower boards are scew nailed to the upperboard. The left and middle lower boards have slightly chamfered top edges but the right board does not, but does show tool marks running off upper edge which suggests that this piece was cut down. Inside the carcass the face of ash (?) backboard is rail tenon and pegged but much less oxidised. Both the style and rail look fresh but are concievably original. The rail is stained on the outside and tenon and pegged to backboard. The top of the backstyle has been cut away to allow the lid to open 180 degrees. Both back legs have been patched at the feet.\nThe drawers hang on battons. There is lining paper on the underside of lid with text 'Honi Soit Qui Mal Pense' (The Garter Motto), surrounded by similar floral patterned block print which also lines both drawers.",
