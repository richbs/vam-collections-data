            "public_access_description": "This suit and shirt was designed especially for Alex Kapranos, singer of Franz Ferdinand, by Hedi Slimane for Christian Dior.\n\nAlex Kapranos had played in various bands during the 1990s, including The Yummy Fur, but got Franz Ferdinand together in 2002. They signed a record deal in 2003 with their first song released going to #43 in the charts. They built on this placing with their second single, Take Me Out which went to #3 in the UK charts, and their debut album also hit #3 in the UK and sold over a million copies in the USA. Their sound drew from early 1980s punk funk artists such as Gang of Four, combining this with inspiration from Roxy Music and Sparks, creating a wired, angular guitar pop sound. They've been nominated for several Grammy awards and their three studio albums have sold over 3.4 million copies worldwide.\n\nSlimane was educated as a tailor before working for Yves Saint Laurent in 1997, and creating his own line at Christian Dior, Dior Homme, in 2000. He was named international designer of the year in 2002 by the Council of Fashion Designers of America in New York. Known for the slim silhouette of his menswear, Slimane also has many connections to the British indie-rock scene, with friendships including Pete Doherty, Alex Kapranos and Amy Winehouse, influencing the aesthetic of contemporary British indie style.",
