It is lined with blue baize (very faded, 2009) and has square compartments with moulded surrounds for candlesticks at the corners and four sunk ovals for coins and counters. The frame is veneered with figured mahogany, and the front legs are of cabriole form carved on the knees with acanthus leaf and finishing in claw and ball feet. The back legs are turned and end in club feet. One back leg and a section of the back rail is hinged at the mid-point of the rear back rail, and pulls out to 90 degrees to support the top when open. At strip of baize lines the upper face of the hinged support where it meets the table top. The fixed half of the top is held from underneath on 6 angled screws (1 missing 2009). There are two carved softwood support blocks glued behind the edges of the front left knee, and 4 corner blocks have been added internally. On the left side end rail (inner face) is a large knot hole.",
