Both could be played on this board and a note with the game stated that the shells and studs were used alternately.",

The playing surface is a special board and set of pegs or marbles made of ivory, bone, wood and later plastic.  The traditional French board is octagonal and has 37 holes to accomodate the same number of pegs.  the traditional English board is circular and has 33 holes or hollows, usually to  accomodate the same number of marbles (33).  Often there is a channel running around the outer edge to hold eliminated pieces.  Some games required all the pieces, others only a certain number.  The pieces are positioned before the start of the game.\n\nFrench Layout                        English Layout\n     * * *                                          * * *\n  * * * * *                                        * * * \n* * * * * * *                                 * * * * * * *\n* * * * * * *     19 IS CENTRE     * * * * * * *              17 IS CENTRE HOLE\n* * * * * * *                                 * * * * * * *\n  * * * * *          HOLE                     * * *\n    * * *                                           * * *\n\nPLAY\nPieces are moved in the same manner in all solitaire games.  Each peg or marble is jumped over an adjoining pieces to an empty space beyond - the piece that has been jumped over is then removed from the board.  Pieces may only be moved horizontally or vertically. \nThe game is considered won only if its objective has been exactly met.  For example the standard game is a success only if the board has beencompletely cleared of all but one of the pieces.  Although some games can be won by more than one method, a player will usually have to take numerous attempts until he has worked out a winning solution.\n\nStandard Solitaire\nThe objective of the basic colitaire is the same whichever type of board is used.  The players tries to clear the board so that at the end of the game only one piece is left, either in the central hole or in some other hole predetermined by the player.\n\nPlay starts from the centre of the board, after the middle piece has been removed.  It is vital that no pieces are left isolated from the others during play as t\ny cannot then be cleared.  if a player wishes, the board can be cleared from some other chosen starting point leaving the central hole filled and removing a piece from elsewhere on the board in order to make a starting point.\n\nSTANDARD MOVES CAN BE:-\n\n5-17, 12-10, 3-11, 18-6, 1-3, 3-11, 30-18, 27-25, 24-26, 13-27,27-25, 22-24,31-23, 16-28,33-31,31-23,4-16, 7-9,10-8,21-7,7-9, 24-10, 10-8,8-22, 22-24, 24-26, 19-17, 16-18, 11-25, 26-24, 29-17.",
