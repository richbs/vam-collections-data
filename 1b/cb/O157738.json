The illusion of stone sculpture was attempted with a very limited palette of colours. In addition the outlines were created with dark metal wire, possibly inspired by the a similar technique used for outlines in ancient floor mosaics.\n\nThe plaque is an example of the skillful translation of unpainted sculptures into micromosaic, a two-dimensional medium that is generally associated with more colourful painterly compositions.\n\nThe term 'micromosaic' is used to describe mosaics made of the minuscule pieces in a glass-like material called smalti (it. enamels). Some micromosaics contain more than 5000 pieces per square inch. First developed in the eighteenth century, micromosaics were particularly fashionable in Neoclassical times.\n\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert (1913-2001) and his wife Rosalinde (1913-1995) formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Their collection is on long-term loan to the Victoria and Albert Museum.",
