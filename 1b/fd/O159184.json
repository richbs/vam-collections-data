This and the decorative bands outlining the contours of zigzags, triangles and small lozenges and the delineated rectangle near the base of each similarly patterned section are worked with black silk. The last 3 cm of the cap on 2 sides has been left unstitched but has been faced. On one of the 4 sections the black silk has worn and been replaced with grey, green or yellow silk and a 6-petalled rosette has been added and one 2 of the base rectangles a black arabesque meander has been worked.\n\nLining: two types of blue plain weave cotton; the quilting stitches, the cords and the embroidery stitches show through this lining.\nFacing: pieced; bias-cut satin with alternate stripes of white and magenta separated by fine yellow and black stripes all woven with blue weft with a small floral motif on the white stripe.\nEmbroidery Thread: black silk, S-twist; with repairs in grey, green and yellow silk; 2S.\nCotton: Z-twist.\nThere is a small cream silk loop at the apex - possibly for a tassel or for hanging.",
