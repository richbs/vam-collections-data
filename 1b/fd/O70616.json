            "public_access_description": "A signature on these cannons records that they were made by the founder 'Nicolai de Bolo' in 1566. 'Bolo' probably stands for Bologna in northern Italy.\n\nA cannon is simply a strong cylinder permanently closed at one end, into which a charge of explosive was placed followed by a stone, iron or lead cannonball. The charge was ignited through a touch-hole, causing it to explode, expelling the ball at a pre-set angle. The most expensive cannon were, like this pair, cast in bronze, and were bored so that the cannonballs fitted closely preventing air from escaping around the cannonball.\n\nCannon were extremely heavy and difficult to manoeuvre on a battlefield but, from a set position, could wreak havoc on cavalry, infantry and on castle walls. Most cannon were cast with two horizontal pins (trunnions) projecting from their sides to allow them to be fitted to a gun carriage, and gunners were equipped with supporting charts and instruments to help calculate the correct angle and amount of explosive for a range of distances. Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia\u2019s La Nova Scientia of 1537 was one of the first detailed studies of the use of such artillery.\n\nAs the moulds in which cannon were cast were expensive to produce and could be used repeatedly, set grades of cannon evolved. The bore (width of barrel) makes these guns half-pounders which, according to a number of slightly later English sources, would be variously classified as 'Robinets' or 'Bases'. They took a charge of 1lb of powder.",

            "historical_context_note": "A cannon is simply a strong cylinder permanently closed at one end, into which a charge of explosive was placed followed by a stone, iron or lead cannonball. The charge was ignited through a touch-hole, causing it to explode, or change to highly compressed gas, very quickly, expelling the ball at a pre-set angle. The best cannon were cast in bronze, and were bored so that the cannonballs fit closely preventing air from escaping around the cannonball.\n\nCannon were extremely heavy and difficult to manoeuvre on a battlefield but, from a set position, could wreak havoc on cavalry, infantry and on castle walls. Most cannon were cast with two horizontal pins (trunnions) projecting from their sides to allow them to be fitted to a gun carriage, and gunners were equipped with supporting charts and instruments to help calculate the correct angle and amount of explosive for a range of distances. Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia\u2019s <u>La Nova Scientia</u> of 1537 was one of the first detailed studies of the use of artillery.\n\nAs the moulds in which cannon were cast were expensive to produce and could be used repeatedly, set grades of cannon evolved. The bore (width of barrel) makes these guns half-pounders which, according to a number of slightly later English sources, (Ward, 1639; Norton, 1628; Eldred, 1646; Nye, 1647) would be variously classified as 'Robinets' or 'Bases'. They took a charge of 1lb of powder.\n\nCannon, bells and mortars were, historically, produced in the same workshops. The alloys for each differed slightly with 'gun-metal' of around 90% copper and 10% tin used for cannon.",
