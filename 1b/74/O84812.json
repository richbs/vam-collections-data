The play tells the story of the Spanish conquest of Peru and the death of the god-king, Atahuallpa. Michael Annals devised a spectacular staging, based on the emblem of the sun, and dressed the Incas in dazzling masks and headdresses. 'We drowned the stage with gold and feathers', said Shaffer. It was a triumph of design which established the 26-year-old Annals as a major talent.\nThis mask is a good example of the ingenuity of the theatrical costume maker. From a distance it appears to be made of beaten copper, but it is, in fact, constructed from fibreboard covered in painted leatherette and is decorated with metal upholstery studs.",

The production opened at the Chichester Festival Theatre and then transferred to the Old Vic. Following its British success, Dexter re-staged the play for the ANTA Theatre, New York, using the same production team. The masks made for the National Theatre were re-used in the Broadway production.\n\nHistorical significance: A fortunate survival from a significant theatre production of the 1960s. Peter Shaffer's epic play was the newly established National Theatre Company's first premiere and a major triumph of direction and design. It established the career of  Michael Annals, who went on to work extensively at the National Theatre and on Broadway.",
