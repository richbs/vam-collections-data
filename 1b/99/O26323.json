The letters are to be distributed one to each player, according to the number about to play, and the remainder laid aside.  They are used to mark each player's position o the Game.\n3.  The numbers, crosses and blank are to be placed in a lady's reticule, and drawn in turn, one by each player, after the manner of a lottery.\n4.  Each player, on drawing a number, is to place his letter on the same number in the Game, and read the description aloud.  When it is his turn to draw another, he adds them together and advances his letter to that number which they make when so added, reading as before, and observing any directions which may be given him.  But if he draw a cross, he is to draw again, till he obtain a number, which number is to be deducted from, instead of added to his former station, and his letter moved back accordingly.  Each card to be returned to the bag after drawing.\n5.  Whoever draws a blank, remains at his former number.\n6.  After each player has drawn once, the Game is to be continued in the same manner, passing the bag round, till some one makes up the exact number 123 who wins the Game.\n7.  If a player go beyond No. 123, he must go as many back as he had exceeded it, and the lottery must continue till some one makes up the exact number.\n8.  If two players arrive at the same number, the one who arrived last must go back to his former number. \n9.  When a player is sent back to any place, he is not to read the description, or attend to the directions in italics, and when sent forward he is only to read the description and stop there till his turn to draw again.\n\nThere follows the EXPLANATION or Description of each of the stops 1 to 123.  The details reveal the date of the Turkish Janissary rebelling against the Sultan in 1823.\n*The back page is damaged and missing so 105 to 109 and 119 to 123 are actually missing their details.\n\nRules placement: booklet",
