In 1929-31 over 130 drawings and water-colours were presented to the National Art-Collections Fund with the intention that the whole collection should be lent for exhibition at galleries in Britain and the Commonwealth, Under these terms, it was exhibited from 1931 until recently; the catalogue of 1947 succeeding that of 1931 with only minor changes.  Now, according to the donor's wishes, a permanent home has been found for the collection: 61 works were selected by the Tate Gallery, 51 by this Museum and the remainder have been distributed by the National Art-Collections Fund among various other collections. \n... \n<b>SUNDERLAND, Thomas (active 1798)</b> \n\nLakeland Landscape: Lake Windermere. \n<i>Inscribed on mount</i> View on Windermere Lake from Storrs. \n<i>Pen and bistre, and colour wash.</i> \n<i>Powell Catalogue</i>, No.119 (repr.)
