Toothpicks have been used for thousands of years. By the sixteenth century wealthy people kept gold and silver toothpicks, some mounted with precious stones, as luxurious accessories.\n\nSmall toothpick cases ensured the security of one\u2019s toothpicks and enabled them to be carried on the body or around the neck. Some like this one were decorated. The engraved and gilded work on this case, and the fixings between lid and body, resemble the tooled leather cases of the Renaissance period that were used, before clothes commonly had pockets, to carry cutlery and other personal items on the body.\n\nBy the Renaissance period picking one\u2019s teeth had become a target in attempts to define dining etiquette and deportment. In 1558 Giovanni Della Casa was commissioned by the Bishop of Sessa to write his <u>Galateo of Manners and Behaviours</u> offering advice to young gentlemen on eveything from appropriate clothing, polite speech, graceful walking and how to avoid seating in public. His views on teeth-picking are clear-cut: \"To be well received you must also be circumspect at table, where it is exceedingly rude to scratch any part of your body, to spit, or blow your nose, (if you can't avoid it turn your head), to eat greedily, to lean your elbows on the table, to sit too far from it, to pick your teeth before the dishes are removed, or to leave the table before grace is said. ...It is also very indecent to rub your teeth with the table cloth or napkin, and to endeavour to pick them with your finger is more so ...\"\n\nDella Casa was not against teeth-picking but stressed is should be done appropriately and with discretion. \"When the table is cleared, to carry about you toothpick in your mouth, like a bird going to build his nest, or to stick behind your ear, as a barber does his comb, is no very genteel custom. They are also undoubtedly mistaken in their notions of politeness, who carry their tooth-pick cases hanging down from their necks: for besides that it is an odd sight for a gentleman to produce anything of that kind from his bosom like some strolling pedlar, this inconvenience must also follow from such a practice, that he who acts thus, discovers that he is too well furnished with every instrument of luxury, and too anxious about everything that relates to the belly: and I can see no reason why the same persons might not as well display a silver spoon hanging about their necks.\" \n\nThe inscriptions on the tooth-pick case, \"MODERATION LASTS\" and \"LACK OF MODERATION RUINS\", emphasise self-control, a subject frequently used on objects associated with eating, and picked up by Della Casa in his manual: \"Neither ought you by any token or gesture to discover that you take too great pleasure in any kind of food or wine; which is a custom more proper for inn-keepers and parasites.\"",
