The ornate carving on the back would have been highly fashionable at about this time, and it includes the Royal Stuart coat of arms before the royal arms were modified at the time of the accession of William III and Queen Mary in 1688.   \n\nThis instrument has recently been attributed to Ralph Agutter, a London maker, who was active at this time. The neck and pegbox are very similar to those belonging to two Agutter violins in private collections, one of which is also carved on the back.",
