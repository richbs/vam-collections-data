London: The Victoria and Albert Museum in association with Hurtwood Press, 1983.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"<i>Alvin Langdon Coburn   American, naturalised British   1882-1966\nThe Dragon   1903\nHalf-tone reproduction\n138 X 177 mm (reproduced same size)   Mus. no. Ph. 36-1981   Purchase</i>\n\nHalf tone reproduction, in which the image on a printing plate is broken up into a regular pattern of dots of different sizes, was not much used in its own right as an exhibition print-making method except during the experimental phase of the process around 1900.  It was mainly used as a method of inexpensive mass reproductions of photographs which could be incorporated with text and printed on letterpress printing machines - unlike photogravure, where special presses were needed.  It provided newspapers and magazines with an economic and practical method of illustration, and brought about the development of photo-journalism and press photography. \nThis example was published by Alfred Stieglitz in <i>Camera Work</i> for April 1904, together with other works by Coburn in photogravure.  Coburn probably asked for his landscape photograph to be printed in green.  The serpentine river in the plains is at Ipswich, Massachusetts.  Coburn attended a summer school there given by the artist Arthur Wesley Dow in 1903.  Through his own wood-block prints and writings Dow became a major channel for the flow of Japanese and Chinese pictorial methods into American art.  He too made a print of the river, emphasising its decorative coils by placing the horizon high in the picture.  The title Coburn gave his photograph is characteristic of his notions about landscape as the site of mythological forces - here implying a Far Eastern source and underlined, as it were, by the colour of the printing ink.\"",
