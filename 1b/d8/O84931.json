Part bird, part beast, the s\u0113nmurw is a creation of Sasanian art, although it was derived from more ancient Babylonian and Assyrian cultures, as well as from the sea-horse of Greek art.\n\nWhen the silk was acquired in 1893, it was said to have come from the tomb of a bishop in Verdun Cathedral, France. Exotic patterned silks were desired not only by European rulers but also reverently valued for use in Christian rituals, such as wrapping relics, and as vestments. Many examples of imported silks have survived in European church treasuries and tombs.",

Winged horses and winged lions were popular beasts in Sasanian mythology but the most striking was the s\u0113nmurw. Part bird, part beast, the s\u0113nmurw is a creation of Sasanian art, although it was derived from more ancient Babylonian and Assyrian cultures, as well as from the sea-horse of Greek art. When the Arabs conquered Iran they took over the Sasanid workshops and incorporated the existing repertoire of designs into their own silk weavings with little modification. The naturalism of Greek art had already, in the few remaining relics of the Sasanid dynasty, given way to a degree of stylisation which was further extended in Byzantine and, more particularly, Islamic textile arts. It is therefore not surprising to find a Sasanian s\u0113nmurw on an Iranian Islamic silk a century or more later. Three figures (visiting ambassadors from the region south of Uzbekistan) on a painting in Afrasiab, an ancient city near Samarkand, wear costumes with Sasanian motifs, including the s\u0113nmurw. The painting is dated to the late 7th century by a Sogdian inscription (Albaoum, L. I., <u>Zhivolis Afrasiab</u>, Tashkent 1975).\n\nThe correct Middle Persian (Pahlavi) form is s\u0113nmurw. One would expect the final -w to become -v in New Persian, but in fact New Persian uses a different dialect form, s\u012bmur\u03b3 (s\u012bmurgh), so the form *s\u0113nmurv does not actually occur; Professor Nicholas Sims-Williams (29/02/2012)",
