Each of the links is lozenge-shaped and made of two slightly convex plaques of open filigree which are joined together at the edges.  The larger links have additional scrolls added to the surface of each side.  Each link is joined to its neighbours by an oval loop of wire, beaded on the outside.",

            "public_access_description": "Gold was the preferred material for traditional jewellery in most parts of Italy in the 19th century.  It was usually fashioned in sheet gold beaten very thinly, or filigree, so that the piece could be made as large as possible.  Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.\n\nThis chain consists of complex filigree links, and probably comes from Venice.  Venice had been famous since the Middle Ages for its fine gold and filigree work, and has continued to make gold jewellery and other luxury goods up to the present day.  It may have been worn in the Veneto, the area around Venice, but similar chains are found throughout the old Venetian colonies of the Adriatic and eastern Mediterranean.  The mix of links of different sizes, with one added as a pendant, is not traditional, and it is likely that this chain was put together in this form from other separate, probably broken, chains.  Although it was described as 16th century when it was acquired by the Museum in 1895 it is more likely to have been made in the 19th century for wear with traditional costume.",
