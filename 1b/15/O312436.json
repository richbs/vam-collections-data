He was educated at home and with his uncle. Then he became a pupil of Sir Robert Smirke and afterwards practised both independently and also in partnership with W.B. Moffat. He was much concerned with the Gothic revival. As such he was responsible for the building or restauration of many churches, cathedrals, chapels and public buildings, like workhouses and schools. He also designed for example the Albert Memorial in Hyde Park, the Glasgow University building, St. Pancras Station and Battersea Power Station and Bankside Power Station, now housing Tate Modern.\n\nGeorge Gammon Adams (b. 1821-1898) was a portrait sculptor and medallist. He designed and exhibited prize medals for the Great Exhibition. In 1852 he was chosen to model the death mask of Wellington. One of his public monuments is the 'Napier' statue in Trafalgar square.",
