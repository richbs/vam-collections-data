            "public_access_description": "The model of the Theatre Royal Drury Lane was made for a child actor, Ren\u00e9e Meyer, when she was appearing in pantomime at the theatre in about 1911. It shows the stage as it was before the reconstruction of the Drury Lane interior in 1921-22. \n\nThe model is built to scale and incorporates all the working parts of the stage.  The proscenium arch is fitted with curtains and a properly balanced fire safety curtain; the fly galleries on either side of the stage are fitted with lines and pulleys which are able to lift the model scenery, and the miniature trapdoors in the stage floor actually work. They include a multi-sided star trap, so-called because, when open, its triangular segments resemble a star. These were used in pantomime for surprise entrances by demons and fairies. They operated on a system of ropes and pulleys and were extremely dangerous.  The performer stood on a small platform beneath the trapdoor and would be propelled upwards through the hinged flaps when weights were released, appearing to burst out of the solid floor.
