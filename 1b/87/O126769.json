There is a hint of Palmer\u2019s \nabsent-mindedness as the caricature \nshows him holding his umbrella \nupside down. The picture forms \nan interesting contrast to the \nglamorized miniature of Palmer \nas a Christ-like artist in full \nAncients\u2019 garb made some five \nyears later (cat. 54). It is a \nreminder of the strong vein of  \nhumour that ran through the \nAncients\u2019 activities. Palmer \nhimself combined visionary \nfervour with self-mockery, as can \nbe seen in his letters to Richmond \n(see cat. 52).\u2019\n<u>Catalogue of an Exhibition of Drawings, Etchings & Woodcuts by Samuel Palmer and other Disciples of William Blake October 20 - December 31, 1926</u>.
