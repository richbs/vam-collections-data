But it is probably Italian. The Virgin and Child are copied from the well known picture knwn as the Madonna della Ghiara in the church of the same name in Reggio Emilia. Lelio Orsi provided the design, which is dated 1569. The image was the subject of a popular cult in Northern Italy and copies of it were worhsipped in Modena, Bologna, Vicenza, Mirandola, Fivizzano and other towns. For an account of the church and the cult, with a useful bibliography, see G. Saccani and others, Il temp della B.V. della Ghiara in Reggio dell\u2019Emilia, Reggio dell\u2019Emilia, 1922.",
