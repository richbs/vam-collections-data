The poem described a series of allegorical visions, and this scene represented the Triumph of Eternity over Time. \n\nSt Jerome and St Gregory accompany the chariot of Eternity. This is the last of the series of Triumphs, and in the complete scene, known from other examples, the chariot rolls over the bodies of all the vanquished: Love, Chastity, Death, Fame, Time. This fragment includes  female figures representing two of the Fates, Clotho and Lachesis, crushed beneath the chariot. (In mythology the Fates controlled the span of human life; Clotho was the spinner, Lachesis was the drawer of lots, and Atropos represented the inevitable end to life).",
