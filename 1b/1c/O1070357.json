Full citation: \n\n\"<b>Unknown Woman\n</b><b>c. 1680</b>\nD.96\n\n<b>Oval 85 x 67 mm\n</b>\nFeatures hatched in brown and sanguine, with blue and red stippling in the shadows, and gum highlights in the eyes, nostrils and lips, on a pale carnation ground; hair in brown wash over the carnation, hatched with darker colour and with pale gouache highlights; dress in transparent blue washes and the lights in white; robe in brown wash, hatched with darker colour and with pale gouache lights; chemise in white, modelled in grey, showing graphite underdrawing round the neckline; background a brown wash, hatched with darker colour and shading to paler colour behind the head; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Small losses in the margins and in the gummed passages. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Not signed.\n\n<b>Frame:</b> A turned oval of ebonised fruitwood, with convex glass and velvet-covered backboard; a nineteenth-century imitation of the late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century pattern. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Acquired from an unrecorded source by Alexander Dyce, and by him bequeathed to the Museum, 1869. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Redgrave 1874, p. 8 (as by Flatman); Foster 1914-16, vol. II, p. 113, no. 57 (as Flatman); Long 192 9, p. 155 (perhaps by Flatman); Long 1930, p. 28 (as attributed to Flatman); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 13 (possibly by Cross).\n\nNo identification has been suggested. Long was the first to question, somewhat mildly, the attribution to Flatman, which seems completely impossible on stylistic grounds. Furthermore, the portrait, which seems to be of c.1680, would be later than any other known work of Flatman. Graham Reynolds dismissed the attribution in a firm note on the file, returning to the question later with the suggestion of 'Lawrence Crosse' (i.e., Peter Cross) written into the annotated departmental copy of Long 1930. This is sensible, for although the execution of the image is in many ways anomalous for a properly trained seventeenth-century miniaturist, the image itself does have an overall 'look' of Peter Cross. It may therefore be an amateur(ish) copy after a Cross original or a more or less conscious imitation of his work.\" ",
