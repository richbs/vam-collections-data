The back of the bodice, which has not survived, would probably have been made of plain linen. An embroidered pattern of exotic birds with large blossoms and leaves covers the front. It combines stylistic elements of chinoiserie design in the birds and aspects of late 17th century English embroidery in the flowers and leaves. The background is cord quilted, a quilting technique where instead of padding, thin cords are inserted between parallel lines of stitching.",
