Then, in an (unsuccessful) attempt to hide her from jealous Hera, he transformed her into a white heifer. The ivory plaque is based on a painting by the Italian artist Antonio Allegri da Correggio (1489-1534). It was probably carved in Germany and probably by an artist in the circle of Jacob Dobbermann in ca. 1750. The gilt metal mounts on the box were made by John Northam 1825-6.\n\nThe Rosalinde and Arthur Gilbert Schatzkammer is one of the few collections of its kind formed in the late 20th century. The Schatzkammer, or treasury, was a new concept in the 16th century. It referred to a special chamber in which the most precious artefacts of a princely collection were housed.  Gold and jewelled objects were mounted alongside exotic natural curiosities, including rock crystal, nautilus shells and ostrich eggs. Together they demonstrated not only the wonders of nature and the technical achievements of the artist, but also the intellect and culture of the patron. \nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
