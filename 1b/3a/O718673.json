Size of sheet 56 x 77.9 cm\nGiven by the architect\nE.281-1913\n\nThese two designs for coats-of-arms demonstrate the attention the architect paid to detail. When the Museum acquired them in 1913 as a gift from the architect himself, among a group of fifty designs for domestic architecture, stained glass, wallpaper, furniture and metalwork, they told the student more about the architect's method of work than the particular project for which they were made. Voysey's own view was that he valued them little, writing 'It tickles my vanity to think that anyone should want my drawings' (letter, 14/1/1913) and 'I have never regarded my drawings more than as a means to an end and the end is all absorbing' (letter 17/2/1913). But as more objects connected with the project have come into the museum's collection they have helped to round out existing knowledge of an interior which has virtually disappeared.'",
