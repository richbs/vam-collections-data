The figures have suffered considerably and the destruction of the heads suggests deliberate mutilation. The top of the block is also hollowed out as if to receive another piece. A fact which taken together with similar sculptures which still remain in their original state, leaves little doubt that the present block originally formed one of the units of a monument consisting of a series of superimposed locks, such as a small pagoda or the memorial to an abbot. Tokiwa Daijo and Sekino Tadashi (Buddhist monuments in China, 1925-1928, Vol. III, pl. 9, 10, 13, 14, and Vol. V, pl. 19, 25, 137); illustrate a number of such sculptured pillars, mostly in the province of Shan-Hsi, including one dated A.D. 857. the majority conforms fairly strictly to type, with a block such as the Museum\u2019s example forming one of the first two units.",
