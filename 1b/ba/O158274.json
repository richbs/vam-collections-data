The design was by David Fairbrother-Roe, using his professional name Daveroe, who used striking psychedelic elements in his artwork to promote the festival. Psychedelia was at its most prominent in popular culture at this time, representing the counterculture in both art and music.\n\nMany British bands played at the 1968 festival, including an earlier incarnation of Marc Bolan's T. Rex (listed on the poster, misspelt, as 'Tyrannosaus Rex'), and one American band, Jefferson Airplane, to a 10,000 strong audience. The festival became annual until the infamous 1970 event, when over 600,000 people attended and most refused to pay, to see acts such as Jimi Hendrix, and The Who. The 1970 festival has gone down in popular history as the major British counterculture event of the decade, and as such was notorious at the time and banned by the authorities and local government. The 2002 revival of the Isle of Wight Festival, other than being held on the island and using the artwork of Daveroe, has no connection to the 1968-70 originals.",
