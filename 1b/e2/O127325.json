His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nSheridan\u2019s The School for Scandal (1777) was performed at the Det Ny Theatre, Copenhagen in 1958.  Directed by Sam Besekow and featuring  Bodil Kjer as Lady Teazle and Olaf Ussing as Sir Oliver Surface, the production received critical acclaim.   Messel\u2019s exuberant pastiche of 18th-century style was well suited to the artificiality and wit of Sheridan\u2019s comedy of manners.",
