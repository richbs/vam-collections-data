Objects of this size were acquired by public collections such as this Museum or by the most ambitious collectors with the grandest houses in which to display them.\n\nHistorical Association\nThis vase is one of two made for the Paris Exhibition of 1867, each painted with a different scene. This was the first showing of the model, and both examples were bought for the Museum. Still further variations were exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1878, where it was described as 'one of the noblest pieces ever produced'.\n\nPeople\nThe modeller of this vase was Victor Simyan (sometimes spelt Simian), a French sculptor who moved to Britain in about 1860.  He founded his own workshop and designed for the pottery industry.  His compatriot L\u00e9on Arnoux (1816-1902) had been art director at Minton's since 1849.  The painter, Thomas Allen, was a local artist. As an apprentice at Minton's he studied at the Stoke-on-Trent School of Design from 1849. In 1852 he became one of the first students to be awarded a National Art Training Scholarship to the School of Design at Somerset House (the forerunner of the South Kensington Museum, later the V&A).  He stayed with Minton's until 1875, when he left to join Wedgwood as chief designer.",

The painter Thomas Allen, worked for Minton from 1854 to 1875 and subsequently for the firm of Wedgwood. It is decorated in imitation of maiolica  though the base is decorated with snakes in the manner of the 16th century French ceramicist, Bernard Palissy. The scenes on the bowl of the vase are taken from prints after works by the Rubens, The Calydonaian Boar Hunt, of which the original painting is now lost, and a second Boar Hunt, now in Marseilles. This vase and its companion took their name however from the cover, where Prometheus is having removed by an eagle, a punishment he was set by Zeus for stealing fire from the gods and bringing it back to earth. The vase is thus a typical 19th century virtuoso piece in its command of technique and visual scenes.",
