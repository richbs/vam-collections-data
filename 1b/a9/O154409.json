McCallum has a great sense of minimal form that is almost as Oriental as the mokume gane technique that he has made his own. What is not there is as important as what is included; curve balances curve, shapes are repeated, echoed, balanced, positive space plays with negative space, light with shadow. In this way a tremendous harmony and tranquillity are created- a type of visual and formal poetry. Function and proportion are integral to the total concept. With only modest and unstressed surface decoration of the handle, the piece nevertheless makes a strong statement: handle and blade work together from tip to tip as one- and not as two separate, conjoined pieces.",
