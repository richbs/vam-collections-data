It has a folding top designed so the table can easily be stored when not needed.  The table was part of a selection of accessories complementing a number of dressed dolls.\n\nPeople\nBetween 1754 and 1814 Laetitia Powell, n\u00e9e Clark, dressed 13 dolls. She also collected accessories, of which this table is one. She married David Powell at St Botolph's Church, Bishopsgate, London in 1761. The couple continued to live in that area, and one of their sons was the grandfather of the founder of the Boy Scouts, General Sir Robert Baden-Powell. Further dolls - dressed by the granddaughters and great-granddaughters of Laetita Powell - were added to the collection up to 1911.\n\nOwnership & Use\nLaetita Powell took ordinary dolls of her time and dressed them in scraps of material left over when she herself had a new gown.  These dolls show both the styles of dress of the period and the types of doll available.  The accessories included other furniture in addition to this tripod table, and household utensils.  Most are late 18th century in date.",
