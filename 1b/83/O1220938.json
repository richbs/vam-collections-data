            "public_access_description": "It was typical of Cranko that he should commission designs for the large-scale Tamining, inspired by Shakespeare's play, from the relatively little-known designer, Elisabeth Dalton. Born in 1940 Dalton had trained at the Wimbledon School of Art and the Slade and began working in design for dance as an assistant to Nicholas Georgiadis. This experience meant that she was already aware that the set had to allow plenty of space for the dancers to move and that the costumes should not restrict the dancers\u2019 movements. \n\nFor The Taming of the Shrew Dalton created essentially a fixed, adaptable architectural setting and, unusually Cranko came to an agreement with his designer whereby Dalton was allowed to create costume designs ahead of the choreography.She recalled in an interview that Cranko said \u2018I\u2019ll choreograph round what you design, but you must work in chronological order.\u2019  Together they built up the characters but in spite of the liberty Cranko gave Dalton she claimed \u2018I don\u2019t think I put a single design on paper before consulting John and his agreeing it despite our race to get to the characters first.\u2019 She found inspiration for the costumes from artists of the Northern Renaissance, most notably for the bodices of the women\u2019s dresses from Lucas Cranach. The peachy-pink dress in the illustrated design was the basic shape for most of the women\u2019s costumes. This costume was designed for Act II Scene I in which the still-rebellious Kate and her new husband journey to Petruchio\u2019s home. Dalton has stuck paper over the dancer\u2019s hair on the design clearly having had second thoughts about Kate\u2019s hairstyle for this scene. The design is annotated with the name of two dancers as in ballet artists alternate in leading parts and from the start the Rhodesian dancer Judith Reyn was learning this role.\n\nCranko\u2019s The Taming of the Shrew was first performed in Stuttgart on 16 March 1969 it was first seen in Britain at the company\u2019s first season at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in the summer of 1974.",
