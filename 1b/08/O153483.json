            "history_note": "Zandra Rhodes considers the Lily prints to be the best of her work, and particularly significant. It was while developing the Lily textiles that she developed the method of reversing the silkscreen to produce a mirror image of the print and create symmetrical patterns. This went on to influence many of her future significant prints, such as 'Lace Mountain', 'Cactus Volcano' and 'Scribble Turnaround'. The Lily prints also represent the introduction of handwriting and calligraphy into her textile designs. Another point of significance for Zandra is that the Lily dresses were the first dresses that she started applying beading to, which would become a future trademark.\n\nThis particular dress is a version of Butterfly No 66/cat no 73/44 as depicted in Rhodes' autobiography (1984), although our dress is cream rather than pink. (The Gallery of Costume at Manchester own a version in the same colourway as in the book). The pigments used in the print are heavier and denser than those on other Lily prints, creating a heavy textured effect.\n\n- Daniel Milford-Cottam\n\nReference:\nRhodes, Zandra and Knight, Anne, <i>The Art Of Zandra Rhodes</i>, London, 1984",
