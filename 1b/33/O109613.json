Thus, as one commentator observed, her costumes 'arrived on stage with past lives.'  \nAlthough the setting for Ondine could be described as Gothic-Romantic, the costume for Berta's wedding dress and those for the guests were based upon those designed by Jean Baptiste Isabey for Josephine and the attendant 12 virgin maids for Napoleon's coronation in Paris in 1804, immortalised in the painting by Jacques Louis David.  The high-waisted Empire line, the wired collar peaks, the tiny leg-of-mutton sleeves are all typical of that period.  At first sight, such a feminine style might seem out of place for the strong-willed Berta, but the silver shimming fabric at once suggests an ethereal, yet steely quality.",

The music for the ballet was composed by Hans Werner Henze, and the scenario was freely adapted by Ashton from the story by Friedrich de la Motte Fouque.  The leading roles were danced by Margot Fonteyn, Michael Somes, Julia Farron, and Alexander Grant.  The dress was made for Deanne Bergsma, who first danced the role of Berta in 1962, although the train probably dates from 1958.",
