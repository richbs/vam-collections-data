This painting was commissioned in 1867 but rejected by the patron, C.P. Mathews of the brewers Ind Coope & Co., before it was completed, on the grounds that Mathews disliked the severed head of Medusa. The subject was to be Perseus holding the severed head of Medusa above a pool of water so that Andromeda was able to look upon its reflection. This study shows Andromeda, whose body was supported by Perseus, leaning over to look down. This particular pose, in which the model (in this case Alexa Wilding) holds her head at an extreme angle, was a favourite of Rossetti's.\n\nRossetti wrote the following poem on the subject: \n\n  Andromeda, by Perseus saved and wed,\n  Hankered each day to see the Gorgon's head: \n  And mirrored in the wave was safely seen \n  That death she lived by. \n\n  Let not thine eyes know\n  Any forbidden thing itself, although\n  It once should save as well as kill; but be \n  Its shadow upon life enough for thee.\n\nThe drawing belonged to C.A. Ionides.",
