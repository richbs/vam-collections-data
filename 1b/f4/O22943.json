Much Habitat furniture was sold 'packed flat' for assembly at home, so that people could 'go into a shop on a Saturday afternoon, pick up a chair in a box, take it away, put it together, and watch Match of the Day in it the same night'. The folding chairs in the room, one of Habitat's cheapest and most popular designs, are based on the 'Trieste' chair, designed by Aldo Jacober and Pierangela D'Aniello in 1966 and sold in Liberty's in 1970 for the high price of \u00a318-15s.\n\n[Michael Snodin, 'British Design at Home', p.159]",
