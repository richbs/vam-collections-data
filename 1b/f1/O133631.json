Professor of Painting at RA 1848-52; his lectures were published as a <U>Handbook for Young Painters</u> (1855). His <u>Life of Reynolds</u> was finished by Tom Taylor and published 1865. Died St John's Wood, London, 5 May 1859. An exhibition at the RA of  30 of his works was held winter 1870. His two sons, George Dunlop and Robert, were also artists. The <u>Athenaeum </u>critic (9 May 1846, p480) wrote that he was 'unrivalled for the certainty of his powers, the <i>wi</i>t of his pencil, the deep knowledge of human nature as exhibited in the more ordinary scenes of life'.\n\nLIT: <u>Art JournaI</u>1856, pp73-5 and 105-7, 1859, p187 (obit); C R Leslie <u>Autobiographical Recollections</u> ed T Taylor, 2 vols, 1860; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by C R Leslie </u> nd [1875]; <u>Art ]ournaI</u>1902, pp 144-8; J Constable <u>The Letters of John Constable and C R Leslie</u> 1931; ed R B Beckett John <u>Constable's Correspondence</u> III, Ipswich 1965 \n\n\n<b>Don Quixote and Dorothea</b>\n FA119 Neg CT7617 \nPanel, 21.6 X 27.8 cm (8\u00bd X 10 15/16 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nA sketch for the picture exhibited at the RA in 1826 (60), and, according to the artist's letter quoted below, painted for the Earl of Essex. The full title given in the RA catalogue was 'Don Quixote having retired into the Sierra Morena to do penance, in imitation of Amadis de Gaul, is prevailed on to relinquish his design by a stratagem of the Curate and the Barber, assisted by Dorothea': the title was accompanied by a long quotation from Cervantes'<i> Don Quixote</i>, part 4 chapter 2. \nTaylor <u>(Leslie</u> II, p167) quotes a letter from Leslie to the American author Washington Irving of 12 January 1826: 'I have for the last six months been very busy with a picture from \"Don Quixote\", ... Those of my friends who have seen it think it will be my best picture, but I never know well what I am about myself till I have done it'. Presumably the present sketch therefore dates from the latter half of 1825. Taylor thought the RA painting 'another good example of the artist's best time as a colourist; but it is not superior in this respect to the little sketch of the subject in the National Collection, which is quite Venetian in its glow of harmonious colour'. \nThe present whereabouts of the RA picture are unknown; it does not seem to have been included in the Cassiobury sale of the Essex collection 12 June 1922, but was sold at Bonham's 8 February 1984 (129, repr in catalogue). It is recorded as having been engraved.\n\nLIT: <u>Leslie</u> I, ppxxxvii-xxxix, II, pp165, 167, 320 \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
