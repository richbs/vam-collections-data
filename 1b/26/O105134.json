Amongst these novelties were the \u2018Pudding Trowle\u2019 such as the one supplied to the Earl of Kildare by Wakelin in 1745. The \u2018trowle\u2019 normally consisted of a triangular blade which was pierced and sawn to various designs;  that this should also be used for fish as well as pudding soon became obvious and by the 1770s when it was suddenly fashionable to eat whitebait, a large number were not only fish shaped in outline but also pierced and chased to represent one. The earliest trowels usually had solid silver handles; later turned and stained ivory handles became the rule. By the 19th century a fish slice was supplied with almost every service of table silver (flatware) and the handles were naturally the same pattern as the rest of the plate.",
