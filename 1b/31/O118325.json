The names of the female clients inscribed on the designs were of the aristocracy, gentry or from wealthy families that moved in the upper reaches of society.  They had homes in the country and came to London for the season.  Retailers who sold such designs were linen drapers and lacemakers, both of which categories existed in London and were available to the clients. Many pattern drawers worked in London where their trade proved a lucrative business during the season. The similarity of some of the designs from this group to those by Styart, whose designs were published in London, does support the argument that these designs came from a retailer's archive based in London.  The fact that this sheet strengthens a design also contributes to the theory that it protects a design that was much in use and thus it  prolonged the pattern's working life.\n\nAttribution note: The design is stitched to a support E.231-1973.  The stitching has been undone so that the inscription can be read.  This was perhaps done by a curator who could see the inscription, by holding the design up to the light, but not read it.  It must have been decided to unpick the stitching.  Either the design was embroidered for Mrs Henry Foster or else she was the embroiderer.  The construction of the sentence does suggest that she is the subject of the verb 'worked' therefore Mrs Henry Foster embroidered the petticoat from this pattern.",
