Adams exhibited two busts of Wellington at the Royal Academy: one in 1854, the other in 1859. This bust is a variant of the those produced by Adams in 1852 that are now located at two English country houses: Stratfield Saye, Hampshire, and Corsham Court, Wiltshire. An additional bronze version of the bust is also in the Museum's collections (inv. no. A.125-1980). Adams was a favoured sculptor of the Duke of Wellington and was chosen to take his death mask, which Wellington's son considered to be the best likeness ever produced of his father. A plaster cast of this is in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Adams began his career as a medallist, training at the Royal Mint under the tutelage of William Wyon (1795-1851). In 1840 he commenced studies in sculpture at the Royal Academy Schools in London, and in 1846 travelled to Rome to train further under John Gibson (1790-1866). He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy between 1841 and 1885, mainly portrait busts and medals.",
