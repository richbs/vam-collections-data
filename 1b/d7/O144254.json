They sold a range of luxury goods such as cosmetics, jewellery, knitwear, accessories and what were called in Paris frivolit\u00e9s. Clients might call in at the boutique following a lengthy fitting to pick up an off-the-peg blouse or some perfume.\n\nHubert de Givenchy (b. 1927) combined the spirit of the boutique with the quality of traditional couture. Like many couturiers he learnt through placements at various houses. He went from Jacques Fath to Lucien Lelong to Robert Piguet, and then to Elsa Schiaparelli for four years, where he designed 'separates' for her pioneering boutique, before opening his own house in 1952.",
