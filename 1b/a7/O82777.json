But this transparency is \"exceptionally rapidly handled\", with the freedom and spontaneity of a first work, and it seems unlikely that the drawing is a study for the painting. Instead it is more likely that Gainsborough developed the ideas begun in the transparency in the drawing, with the addition of two cows in the foreground.",

I, no. 3, July 1965, repr. fig. 5 (reversed); Hayes, <i>Drawings</i>, p. 287. \n\nGainsborough was familiar with transparency painting, and had himself painted transparencies for the decoration of Bach and Abel's concert rooms in Hanover Square, London, opened in February 1775; but it seems to have been de Loutherbourg's <i>Eidophusikon</i>, first shown in February 1781, which inspired his own 'peep-show' for displaying his ideas for landscapes (see pp. 140-42). Gainsborough's rather amateurish box (pls 171, 172) consisted of a large storage space, containing twelve slats, to house his transparencies; a system of cords and pulleys to hoist the desired transparency into position; four slats behind this position, into anyone of which could be inserted a semi-transparent silk screen; and, at the back, five candle-holders. The spectator viewed the transparencies through a large round peep-hole, fitted with a magnifying lens, in the front of the box. The lens could be adjusted to between 25\u00bd and 34\u00bd inches of the projected transparency, thus producing an image with a magnification of between two-and-a-half and five times the size of the original, according to the length of adjustment. The light transmitted from the candles behind, albeit diffused through the silk screen, produced a luminosity close to that in nature impossible to achieve in oil painting on an opaque support. It is not known whether the transparencies were intended to be viewed with the painted surface facing the candle or the spectator; there is optical evidence to favour the former method, but this matter, and others connected with the box, require further investigation (the reproductions in the present catalogue are all of the painted surface). (I am grateful to Mr Lionel Lambourne and Mr John Murdoch, of the Victoria and Albert Museum, for their help, and for allowing me to examine the official file.) Gainsborough must have painted numerous transparencies for showing in his box, but only ten survive (this one and cat. nos 133, 134, 139, 140, 154, 155, 172, 173 and 177): all these are completely tonal in quality, executed in a range of blues, greens and browns, and Gainsborough's aim was clearly to heighten and dramatize his effects of light. A drawing owned by Christian Mustad (154a; Hayes, <i>Drawings</i>, no. 779), which differs from the transparency in a number of minor ways, and also includes two cows in the foreground, seems more likely to have been worked up later from this exceptionally rapidly handled transparency than to be, in any sense, a study for it. Gainsborough's transparencies were, in essence, studies anyway. For other cases where drawings seem to have been made <i>from</i> the transparencies, rather than the other way about, see cat. nos 172 and 173. The strongly rhythmical design is characteristic of this period, and the motif of figures crossing a bridge had been used in the Washington and Cardiff landscapes (cat. nos 151, 153). Also mentioned on pp. 140-41, 142.\n \nDATING Closely related to cat. nos 151 and 153 in the rapid, washy handling of all the forms, the soft modelling of the mountains and bushy trees and the motif of travellers crossing a stone bridge.\"",

Gainsborough's rather amateurish box [which is also in the V&A, museum number P.44-1955, illustrated in Hayes, pls 171, 172] consisted of a large storage space, containing twelve slats, to house his transparencies; a system of cords and pulleys to hoist the desired transparency into position; four slats behind this position, into anyone of which could be inserted a semi-transparent silk screen; and, at the back, five candle-holders. The spectator viewed the transparencies through a large round peep-hole, fitted with a magnifying lens, in the front of the box. The lens could be adjusted to between 25\u00bd and 34\u00bd inches of the projected transparency, thus producing an image with a magnification of between two-and-a-half and five times the size of the original, according to the length of adjustment. The light transmitted from the candles behind, albeit diffused through the silk screen, produced a luminosity close to that in nature impossible to achieve in oil painting on an opaque support. It is not known whether the transparencies were intended to be viewed with the painted surface facing the candle or the spectator; there is optical evidence to favour the former method, but this matter, and others connected with the box, require further investigation. Gainsborough must have painted numerous transparencies for showing in his box, but only ten survive [two further transparencies in the V&A, P.38-1955 and P.40-1955, were painted by another artist at a later date]. All ten are completely tonal in quality, executed in a range of blues, greens and browns, and Gainsborough's aim was clearly to heighten and dramatize his effects of light.",
