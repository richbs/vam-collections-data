It is found in glass, red-stoneware, porcelain, creamware and pearlware. After about 1800 its popularity waned in favour of the 'Dutch' jug with straight neck and globular body.\n\nTrade & Trading\nTowards the end of the 18th century, trade with the new-founded United States of America (particularly the slave trade) had shifted from Bristol to Liverpool, which already handled massive exports of pottery from Staffordshire. Soon the United States was bombarded with goods of all kinds, including creamware jugs and mugs celebrating its separation from Britain. These were made in Liverpool and Staffordshire by ambitious potters for whom business came before national pride. The list of States on this jug shows that it was made after Kentucky joined the Union in 1792, but before the admission of Tennessee in 1796.\n\nMaterials & Making\nIt was not long after the perfection of plain creamware in the early 1760s that its bare surfaces were ornamented with overglaze black printing. By 1762 the Staffordshire potter Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) had engaged the services of the pioneer printers Sadler & Green in Liverpool. There, with the huge popularity of satirical and political cartoons in the wake of the French Revolution, the technique was exploited to the full, using both Staffordshire and locally-made creamwares.",
