She remained at Paquin until 1936, the same year Jeanne Paquin died, when she also left and was succeeded by Ana de Pombo. During the Second World War, de Pombo returned to Spain, and her former assistant, Antonio del Castillo, was artistic director.\n\nIn 1945, del Castillo left to work for the American entrepreneur Elizabeth Arden, and was replaced by Colette Massignac, who was at Paquin until 1949. Lou Claverie succeeded her, and in 1953, he was replaced by the American designer Alan Graham, who designed the last few collections for Paquin before its closure on 1 July 1956.",
