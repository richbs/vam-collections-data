The other figure is Dalpat Ujjainiya, wearing the four-pointed jama of Akbar's reign. The painting was probably done in Jahangir's accession year, and is attributed to the artist Manohar in the lower border. It was later remounted for an album of Shah Jahan, when the floral borders characteristic of his reign were added.",
