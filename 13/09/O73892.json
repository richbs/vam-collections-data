The costume consists of a purple silk satin blouse with silk embroidery and woolen  panels and a red cotton and silk pinstriped skirt, partly concealed by colourful aprons. Separate white satin sleeves edged in red wool and a long hood of lilac Chinese damask and red imported English wool complete the outfit. The use of imported materials--whatever their quality and however arranged--was a sign of wealth and status.\n\nThe Palaung of Taingbaing (also spelt Taungbaing or Tawngpeng - the principality within the North Shan States, whose capital was Namhsan, north east of Mandalay) are a hill people, whose long established involvement with tea cultivation and trade made them richer than most of the other hill communities who practised slash and burn agriculture.",

The costumes worn at the courts of the major Shan sawbwas closely resembled those worn at the Court of  the kings at Mandalay.",
