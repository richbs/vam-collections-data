It would have been impossible to use as a vessel due to its weight, its small foot and its awkwardly-placed handle.  Both the ewer and the basin are lavishly decorated with images of classical deities surrounded by strapwork patterns and embossed designs of fruit and foliage.  Heavy, elaborately decorated objects like these were not functional but were made solely for display and would have been seen at grand dinners held by fashionable Venetians.",

            "historical_context_note": "Before the second half of the 16th century when the use of personal forks at the dining table became widely established across Italy, dining could be a very messy affair. Although knives and spoons were in frequent use, forks were largely confined to the final 'banqueting' course, for eating sticky sweetmeats and fruits. As a result the ceremony of handwashing took on great significance. At the beginning and end of a meal, a ewer and basin were brought to the dining table by servants so that diners could wash their greasy hands from a basin replenished with flower-scented water poured from the ewer. Since basins were brought to each guest and appreciated at close range, they were often elaborately decorated. \n\nBy the time this ewer and basin were made most wealthy Italian households would have used forks on a regular basis for grand dining occasions, limiting the need for  handwashing. This pair was therefore probably made for public show, a demonstration of magnificence, rather than for use. This is also suggested by the top-heavy design of the ewer, rendering it impractical. The large size, gilding and fashionable hammered decoration of the pieces would have advertised to guests the wealth and taste of the owner. They would probably have been placed in a prominent position on a <font -i>credenza</font> (a form of dresser, often a temporary tiered structure erected for specific occasions) alongside other silver and silver-gilt vessels in the same room where the meal was taking place.",
