Lady Anne is standing to the left, leaning against the structure with her right hand on her breast, and is wearing a turban over her curls and a light gown with neo-classical drapery.  Her two younger children, both in plain white dresses, are by her feet: the smaller of them, seated on the ground, has removed a shoe and is examining it.  The two elder boys, presumably John and William, are on the right of the group, dressed alike in early versions of the skeleton suit: double-breasted tops of dark satin, worn over white shirts with wide frilled collars and the sleeves rolled up, and light coloured trousers with fall fronts; the elder carries a sword which he is in the process of unsheathing.",
