Alternate rows of knots are pulled in different directions because two knots (counted vertically along the warp) share three warp threads.  The slant is not done intentionally - it is the by-product of the off-set knotting and the absence of a sinuous weft in the second shed, which might have pulled them into common alignment.\nNOTE: off-set knotting can add stability to a structure when there is only one weft after every two rows of knots. One weft every two rows makes a finer carpet.\nSIDE FINISH: one cord oversewn with red wool.\nEND FINISH: Lower: one row of weft twining with red and green wool above a warp fringe 3\" (7.5 cm) long.   Upper: as lower with warp fringe 5\" (15 cm) long.\nDESIGN: Field: dark brown ground with a small-scale Herati pattern with light blue and green leaves.  There is a central diamond shaped medallion with a small pendant-like extension top and bottom.  The pattern and colouring is like that of the field.  Around this is a very large slightly serrated diamond medallion whose sides have been cut by the borders.  The pattern is as the other areas but on a white ground. \nMain Border: yellow ground with a green meander outlined in red with small serrated leaves in brown and white, a diagonal bud in white and red and a full blossom alternating in white/red/brown and white/red/light blue.\nInner and Outer Borders: light blue ground with a thin brown meander with red flowers and yellow leaves and buds.\nCatalogue Date  5 April 2000",
