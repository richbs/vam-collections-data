The sitter is here depicted in a lavish satin dress in blue and orange with several strings of pearls, typical of the 1650s\u2019 fashion in France. The Beaubrun were highly regarded for their state portraits and provided a wide range of female portraits, which appears to be an important testimony of the aristocratic representation in 17th-century France although they all look quite mechanically executed.",

Charles and Henri were cousins, and both pupils of their uncle Louis, who was head of the workshop until his death in 1627. They were popular at the court of Louis XIII (1610-43) and in the early years of the reign of Louis XIV, but their popularity did not survive the success of Le Brun in the 1660s. Charles and Henri worked together; Louis XIV, it is said, used to enjoy watching them applying brush-strokes to a painting one after the other without any apparent difference in style. Their known portraits cover the period 1630-c. 1670. \n\n<i>Lit.</i> G. Wildenstein, 'Les Beaubrun' in <i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</i>, lvi, 1960, pp. 261-74. \n\n\nAscribed to Charles & Henri \nBEAUBRUN \n\n17 \nA LADY SAID TO BE JEANNE DE \nMARIGNY \n<i>Canvas</i> \n50\u00bd x 33\u00bc (128 x 84.5) \nJones Bequest \n566-1882 \n\nThis painting was variously attributed to Nicolas and to Pierre Mignard until a replica was discovered in a private collection in New York which had been ascribed to Charles and Henri Beaubrun by Charles Stirling. This attribution is supported by a comparison with signed works by the Beaubrun, such as the portrait of the Duchesse de Montpensier in the Prado, Madrid (Wildenstein, <i>op. cit.</i>, fig. 11). \n     The sitter of 566-1882 was formerly said to be the Duchesse de Montpensier but this identification is contradicted by a comparison with known portraits of her such as the one mentioned above. The New York version has traditionally been described as Jeanne de Marigny. Nothing is known of her, but her very obscurity supports the identification, for invented names are usually those of well-known historical personages. The sitter's action dispensing coins and jewellery is doubtless intended to illustrate her liberality. \n     To judge from the costume, the portrait may be dated c. 1650-60.

Victoria & Albert Museum, HMSO, London, 1990. p.xix-xx\n\nJohn Jones (1800-1882) was first in business as a tailor and army clothier in London 1825, and opened a branch in Dublin 1840.  Often visited Ireland, travelled to Europe and particularly France.  He retired in 1850, but retained an interest in his firm.  Lived quietly at 95 Piccadilly from 1865 to his death in January 1882.  After the Marquess of Hertford and his son Sir Richard Wallace, Jones was the principal collector in Britain of French 18th century fine and decorative arts.  Jones bequeathed an important collection of French 18th century furniture and porcelain to the V&A, and among the British watercolours and oil paintings he bequeathed to the V&A are subjects which reflect his interest in France.  \n\nSee also <u>South Kensington Museum Art Handbooks.

Pictures,... and other things</u>, p.138, \"The pictures which are included in the Jones bequest are, with scarcely a single exception, valuable and good; and many of them excellent works of the artists.  Mr. Jones was well pleased if he could collect enough pictures to ornament the walls of his rooms, and which would do no discredit to the extraordinary furniture and other things with which his house was filled.\"\n\nHistorical significance: Formerly attributed to Nicolas (1606-1668) and then Pierre Mignard (1612-1695), Charles Sterling reattibuted this painting to Charles and Henri Beaubrun. An exact copy of 566-1882 in miniature is in the Royal collection, Windsor (RCIN 421458), and it was in fact not unusual that miniaturists copied the paintings of renowned artists. For instance, two miniatures after Beaubrun's portraits of the Queen Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and the Grand Dauphin were made by Joseph Werner (1637-1710), Mus\u00e9e de l'Histoire de France, Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles. \nThe sitter is traditionally identified as Jeanne de Marigny whereas very little is known about her life and no other portraits of her are known. She is depicted in profile while facing the spectator and wears a lavish satin dress in blue and orange with puffed leaves and a tight corset pervaded by strings of pearls, typical of the French fashion of the 1650s. Some coins are dropping out of her hand, a symbolic elements in the 'vanitas' theme, which invite to a meditation upon death but may also allude to the vanity personified \n566-1882 is a fine example of the Beaubrun's production of female portraits, which always present the sitter in the same position: three-quarter profile, generally facing left, with very little variations in the depiction of the long heavy hands and arms while the lines of the boneless shoulders and neck appear also very similar from one sitter to another. The background can be either a dark neutral setting or a landscape in which case it was most likely depicted by another artist.\nThis portrait resemble very much other painting attributed to the Beaubrun, especially the Portraits of Anne of Austria with the Grand Dauphin, Prado Museum, Madrid (P02291), <i>La Grande Mademoiselle</i>, Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet, Paris, and the portrait of Claire-Cl\u00e9mence de Maill\u00e9, Princess of Cond\u00e9, Duke of Maill\u00e9 collection, Ch\u00e2teau de Ch\u00e2teauneuf-sur-Cher, who is depicted in a very similar blue and orange dress. \nThe Beaubrun achieved a considerable success as court painters but their art became gradually old-fashioned during the second half of the 17th century. Although their output must have been quite prolific, only a few paintings had survived, a number of which may still be wrongly attributed to Mignard. Their oeuvre appears particularly interesting from an iconographical point of view and must be therefore considered as an important testimony of the 17th-century aristocratic representation in France.",

            "historical_context_note": "In his encyclopaedic work, <i>Historia Naturalis,</i> the ancient Roman author Pliny the Elder described the origins of painting in the outlining of a man's projected shadow in profile. In the ancient period, profile portraits were found primarily in imperial coins. With the rediscovery and the increasing interest in the Antique during the early Renaissance, artists and craftsmen looked back to this ancient tradition and created medals with profile portraits on the obverse and personal devise on the reverse in order to commemorate and celebrate the sitter. Over time these profile portraits were also depicted on panels and canvas, and progressively evolved towards three-quarter and eventually frontal portraits. \nThese portraits differ in many ways from the notion of portraiture commonly held today as they especially aimed to represent an idealised image of the sitter and reflect therefore a different conception of identity. The sitter's likeness was more or less recognisable but his particular status and familiar role were represented in his garments and attributes referring to his character. The 16th century especially developed the ideal of metaphorical and visual attributes through the elaboration of highly complex portrait paintings in many formats including at the end of the century full-length portraiture. Along with other devices specific to the Italian Renaissance such as birth trays (deschi da parto) and wedding chests' decorated panels (cassoni or forzieri), portrait paintings participated to the emphasis on the individual.\nPortrait paintings were still fashionable during the following centuries and extended to the rising bourgeoisie and eventually to common people, especially during the social and political transformations of the 19th century. At the end of the 19th century and during the 20th century, painted portraits were challenged and eventually supplanted by the development of new media such as photography.",
