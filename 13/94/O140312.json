This albumen print, a type of photograph, dating to 1865 -1870,  is the work of the firm of Francis Skidmore (1817-1896) known as Skidmore's Art Maufactures and Constructive Iron Company, which was at Alma Street, Coventry.  The photograph is by an unknown photographer and is a record of the work done and comes from an archive of designs and photographs from the firm.  Skidmore was a leading Victorian metalworker and  was best known for his innovative architectural ironwork of which this finial is an example. Many patterns of similar finials are published in a pattern book of designs from Skidmore's firm held in the Public Library, Coventry.",
