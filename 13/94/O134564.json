It sems from their clothing that the performers on stage are dancers, and one is leaning against an upright piano.  This is possibly a rehearsal for The Desert Song which followed Rose Marie in Drury Lane Theatre in 1927.\n\nThe artist Peter Bax worked at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane as a stage manager and a stage designer before moving to the British Broadcasting Company as a Studio Manager in 1934.  He was one of the original team of people - several of which were recruited for their theatre backgrounds - to be appointed by the BBC to start preparations for high-resolution broadcasting.  After the war he became the Artistic Director at Alexandra Palace, the home of  BBC television after1936.",
