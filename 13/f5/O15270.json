By the 1930s she was combining machine and hand embroidery to produce her highly individual designs. \n\nA pioneer of mixed techniques and fabrics, Crompton utilised raw edges as part of the design process, as seen in this piece from about 1936. Although criticised by traditional embroiderers for her experimentation, Crompton revolutionised many of the previous thoughts on embroidery and dress in the schools of art, stating \u2018extreme neatness in design is not necessarily a good thing artistically.\u2019",
