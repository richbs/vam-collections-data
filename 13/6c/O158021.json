It once formed part of a 21-piece lady\u2019s toilet service, weighing in total over 11 kilos. The cipher on the cover is for Judith Bridgeman, daughter of Sir John Bridgeman (d.1713), second baronet of Castle Bromwich, Warwickshire.\n\nOutside the wealthiest court circles, 17th century silver was used primarily for eating and drinking. The dining table was the heart of social activity, and novelty items were made for fashionable new drinks flavoured with spices and drinking games.  The range of British silver for the home from this period (the first for which a representative quantity survives) demonstrates increasing foreign influences from France, the Netherlands and Portugal. The rising demand for fashionably decorated European silver from the 1660s onwards reflects Britain\u2019s new wealth and political stability. \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
