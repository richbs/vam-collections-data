Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nThis drawing of Harry Anderson probably dates from about 1952 and he may have been conducting one of the big musicals that regularly visited the New Theatre in the 1950s, either for a pre-London try-out tour or a post-London tour.",

He became well-known in the profession and his ability as a caricaturist became common knowledge.  The volume that includes this drawing contains sketches mostly of musical directors and conductors working at the Oxford New Theatre with Gilbert Sommerlad.",
