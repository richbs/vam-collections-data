It was one of a series of ten marble busts portraying Cobham and his friends and political associates. The busts were ranged round the walls on plinths, apparently surrounding the dining table at which Cobham entertained his friends.\n\nPeople\nLord Cobham was a career soldier and an opposition Whig in conflict with the government led by Sir Robert Walpole. His house and estate at Stowe were the focus for a number of opposition figures, and many of the buildings, monuments and sculptures set out in the gardens and park symbolised his political philosophy, notably his commemoration of British Worthies, such as Sir Isaac Newton and Elizabeth I, representing great historical figures who personified freedom of thought or momentous historic action.\n\nMaterials & Making\nMarble busts were among the most prestigious types of portrait undertaken in Britain during the 18th century. The marble, a relatively expensive material, was imported, usually from Italy via The Netherlands, since there are no marble quarries in this country. The skills needed to carve marble could also be learnt abroad, where an aspiring artist would probably gain his most important training assisting an established sculptor.",

It was there sold to 'Russell' for \u00a38 8s, who was a London dealer. The vendors of the present piece noted that it was said to have come from the Earl of Jersey's collection; it this is correct the Earl must have bought it from Russell or a subsequent owner. The V&A purchased the bust from Messrs Kerin, 15 Davies Street, London, for \u00a3100.",
