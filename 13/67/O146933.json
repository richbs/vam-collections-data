His particular brand of abstraction was rooted in Cubism but also derived much from daily objects he found around him, such as packaging and advertising. His characteristically colourful, hard-edge paintings suggest rather than depict contemporary American life. He frequently introduced lettering or numbers into his compositions and the rhythms of Jazz inspired the dynamic patterns in the work.  His impact was most strongly felt on the up-coming generation of Abstract Expressionists and Pop artists. [Another impression of this print is Circ.128-1969]",
