Chestnut urns, usually made in a distinctive Neo-classical style, were kept on the sideboard and formed part of the furnishings of a dining room.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe urn is decorated by a process known as japanning.  This was an imitation of East Asian lacquer widely used on furniture and base-metal wares from the 17th to the 19th centuries.  A series of coats of black asphaltum varnish were applied to the surface of the urn, which was then dried in an oven, which effectively baked them on to the surface.  This was then heightened with gold, often with popular Chinoiserie designs.  The process was first developed at Bilston in Staffordshire, but was also used in Monmouthshire at Pontypool and Usk.\n\nOwnership & Use\nIn the late 18th century, boiled and roasted Spanish chestnuts were popular in Britain as a dessert. These urns were for carrying the hot chestnuts from the hearth to the dining table.  When not in use they formed an attractive addition to the furnishings of a dining room.",
