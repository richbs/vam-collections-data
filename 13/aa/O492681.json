Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this netsuke of a horse.  \n\nThe positioning of this horse, with its four hooves grouped together, alludes to the horseman Oguri Hangan who was said to be able to make his horse stand with all four hooves on a single chess board.",
