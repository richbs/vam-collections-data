            "public_access_description": "Anne Rook produces art inspired by the food industry, consumerism and globalisation. Many of her works take food labels and packaging as a starting point. She gathers PLU (price look up) labels from supermarket shelves which provide a code to the retailer on the origin and price of fresh produce.  Rook reproduces them in their hundreds, by scanning and then cutting out by hand. She then pastes these together, in collages to suggest made-up supermarket dishes, or, in the case of apples, directly onto the surface of the fruit,. She then scans again to provide flat images which are boxed in the type of plastic containers used to present ready-meals.  Other works take the form of 'interventions' in traditional textile or wallpaper designs, where labels subtly replace fruit and flowers in the designs. Sometimes an actual tree will be transformed by a skin of  label- printed cloth. These witty and decorative designs serve to remind us that food production and marketing is more to do with mass production and corporate profit and less to do with  taste, flavour and ecologically balanced agriculture.\n\nThese works were displayed in 'Flypitch' a series of displays in Brixton Market, South London in which every Saturday over a two month period in 2003 a different artist was commissioned to fill a market stall with work which related directly to issues of commerce - but which also carried deeper messages about the nature of business, buying, selling and consuming.",
