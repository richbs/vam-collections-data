Brightly coloured silk shoes complemented the richness of the gown, often matching the sash or the long fluttering ribbons worn in the hat. They came in a wide variety of colours, including the \u2018canary yellow\u2019, \u2018palm-leaf green\u2019 and \u2018marshmallow blossom\u2019. Delicate bows and rosettes enhanced the daintiness of the shoe and foot.\n\nDue to their fragility, silk \u2018slippers\u2019 were usually reserved for indoor wear, evening dress or special occasions. Looking at these examples it is not difficult to see why. Although the toes are lined with linen and the back of the upper with kid, they were clearly not made to last. Some writers complained that silk shoes became distorted and ugly after a few days wear. They were also probably uncomfortable as the toes are narrow, square and very shallow.",
