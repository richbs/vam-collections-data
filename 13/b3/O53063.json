It came from a London house at 44 Berkeley Square, which was designed for her by the architect William Kent (1685-1748).  We know that Kent bequeathed her 'four heads busto's' of the thinkers Isaac Newton (1642-1727), John Locke (1632-1704),  Samuel Clarke (1675-1729) and William Wollaston(1659-1724) and it is possible that those, or others from her collection, sat upon brackets of this pattern.\n\nThe form derives from a volute, the double scroll on which the classical motif of the ionic capital is based. Such scrolled brackets were highly fashionable elements in the interior decoration of houses in the Palladian style, built in the 18th century. Here this shape is ornamented with a scale pattern and acanthus leaves - both stylised motifs based upon natural forms.  The painted finish resembles stone and would have blended well with painted panelling or plasterwork.",

In a letter dated 13 November 1974 (RF 74/2854, on Nominal File, John Fowler), he recorded that it had come from 44 Berkeley Square, when he worked on the house about 14 years previously.  It was 'found when a door had to be made for access to the bar as I remember and lay about for a long time.  I could not use it there again as there was no where suitable. As it would have undoubtedly have got thrown away I salvaged it with the V&amp;A in mind. \n   I have always assumed it is one which Lady Isabella Finch had made when she was left Kent's bustos at his death. It may be too ordinary a thing to go with all yr other beauties. As you see it is in untouched condition'. \n\n44 Berkeley Square was built for Lady Isabella Finch to the designs of the architect William Kent (1675-1748).  In his will he left her 'four heads busto's Newton, Clarke, Lock [sic] and Woolaston [sic].  These may have been terracotta studies by Giovanni Battista Guelfi, an Italian sculptor who worked in England from about 1720 to 1734, for busts of the same men that he made for the Hermitage of Queen Caroline in Richmond Park.  The terracottas may have ended up on such brackets, with others from Lady Isabella's collection.",
