He participated to the first 'Salon des Refus\u00e9s', which took place in Fran\u00e7ois Bonvin's (1817-1887) atelier in 1859, where he befriended Corot. He had a short career and died at the early age of 37. A retrospective exhibition of his oeuvre took place at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in 1876.\n\nThis is a fine example of Guillaume R\u00e9gamey's art he devoted almost entirely to the depiction of horses and horsemen. This painting shows three Percheron horses climbing up a hillock under a bright sky while a man behind them is emptying a mud cart. This representation of labouring horses provided the artist with the possibility of depicting horses' anatomy from different point of view. The bright light and the earthen palette are typical of the Naturalist movement.",

A. I, 11/03/1873, NAL 86.NN.Box II). Bequeathed by Constantine Alexander Ionides, 1900.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a fine example of R\u00e9gamey's art and shows a mud cart driven by three Percheron horses. They are climbing up to the summit of a hillock, moving away from the spectator. This compositional formula is characteristic of Regamey who often employed figures seen from the back receding into the distance such as in CAI.73.\nPercheron horses originate in the area known as \"Le Perche\" in the north west of France and are imposing animals used to carry massive loads. They are particularly adapted to the farm labours and may have provided interesting features for the artist who devoted almost entirely his oeuvre to the depiction of horses. Many sketches of horses in all sorts of position are currently housed in the Louvre, Paris.\nThere is a preparatory drawing in the Louvre, Paris (RF 22601), signed and dated 1860, 10 years before the execution of the finished version, which suggests that R\u00e9gamey used to rework his compositions over the years. \nThis painting was possibly commissioned by Constantine Alexander Ionides, whom R\u00e9gamey had probably met through the intermediary of Legros during the winter 1870-71 in London. At that time, R\u00e9gamey was sharing Legros' studio in London and collaborating to the <i>Illustrated London News</i>.",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists.",
