The dress consists of a pair of orange panniers edged with several rows of ruffles, which open to reveal a pair of knee length orange and silver bloomers.  The outfit is completed with a pair of high heeled silver shoes, and a large curly white wig which extends on either side of the head and is surmounted by a hat which consists of an orange frill and decorated with four artificial white mice.",
