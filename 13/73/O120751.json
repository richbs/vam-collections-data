            "physical_description": "Two walnut figures, painted and gilded.  They are very similar in their physical type: both have symmetrical rounded faces, with small, neat features, and slightly heavy eye-lids.  Their hair is golden, and worn loose; it is formed from individual gilded curls.  Both wear the typical circlet head-dresses common to many Netherlandish carved figures of this period, made up of twisted ribbon and large pearls, with a plain layer covering the head.  Both figures hold books with tiny stylised writing, and both figures have punched decoration to the border of their gold mantles.\nBoth figures have suffered wood worm damage.  The central section of their backs has been left largely uncarved and unpainted, showing that they were intended to be viewed from the front and sides only.  On the underside of both is a large plugged hole, and two smaller nail holes.  It is possible that the larger holes were inserted to attach the two figures to the Brixen altarpiece (192-1866) in the 19th century, while the smaller holes are original.\n[Statuette St. Barbara] St Barbara holds a book in her right hand and a tower, her traditional attribute, in her left. The top of the tower is slightly damaged. Her dress has an X-shaped band on the chest, painted to simulate ermine.  Her mantle is gilded with a dark lining, and is held up, across her body, by her right hand.  The base of the figure is damaged.\n[Statuette St Catherine] St Catherine holds a book in her right hand.  At her feet is the figure of the Emperor Maxentius, trampled under her feet.  Her right hand is damaged, but would originally have held a sword, reaching down to the front of the emperor's crown.  An indentation remains on the crown where the tip of the blade would have rested.  Her dress and mantle are gold: the dress has punched border decoration as well as the mantle.  The mantle has a dark green-blue lining.  On the top of her head appears to be the indistinct mark of the Brussels mallet.\nThe figure of Maxentius is shown at bust length to St Catherine's proper right.  He has a dark green tunic, with a gold collar and armlets.  His crown is gold, with a black edge, and his beard and hair are black, with gold highlights.  His face is finely painted.  Behind St Catherine's proper left side are the damaged remains of his leg(?).  The wheel smashed beneath him is gold, and he lies on green grass.\nThe base of the figure is damaged, and the top of the book cover has lost all paint layers.  St Catherine's nose and the lining of her mantle have been severely attacked by wood worm.\nThe figure overall is relatively flat in profile.",

But during the 1930s it was discovered that they were not actually originally related to the altarpiece, and were therefore removed from it.\n\nThe two figures actually originate from Brussels, rather than the Tyrol, and were produced in about 1500.  They are very similar to surviving figures which have the mark 'BRVESEL' stamped on their base, and are typical of a type of production which became very popular during the later 15th century.  The remains of what might be the Brussels mallet mark remain on the top of St Catherine's head.\n\nSt Barbara holds her traditional attribute of the tower in which she was imprisoned by her father, while St Catherine tramples on the figure of her persecutor, the Roman emperor Maxentius, and the remains of the wheel on which she was tortured.\n\nThe carved figures from Brussels were used as individual devotional images, or set into small altarpieces, or \"house altars\", with painted wings.  Two complete examples survive with figures of Sts Catherine and Barbara flanking the Virgin and Child - the two female saints were evidently popular with consumers.  Nearby Malines also became a centre of production for carved and painted wooden figures in the early 16th century.  These were strongly influenced by the Brussels style.",
