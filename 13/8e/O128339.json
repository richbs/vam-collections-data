He may also have travelled to Naples, Venice and Bologna. Around 1731 Boucher returned to Paris where he rapidly gained the royal favour and interest from private collectors. He was a very prolific artist and produced a wide range of artworks from pastoral paintings, porcelain and tapestry designs as well as stage designs influencing deeply the new Rococo movement.\n\nThis painting is a copy after a composition signed and dated by Boucher in 1741. It depicts the allegory of Air and originally belongs to a series of four paintings depicting the Elements. 595-1882 forms a pendant with another copy after Boucher's Allegory of Fire (596-1882). This work is a fine example of the early career of Boucher, who already pervaded his oeuvre with mischievous pastoral scenes which would become the hallmark of his art and eventually of the whole rococo period.",

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 41-42, cat. no. 39\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Fran\u00e7ois BOUCHER (1703-70) \n<i>French School</i> \nBorn in Paris, he was a pupil of his father, a designer of embroidery, of Fran\u00e7ois Lemoyne and of the engraver Jean Fran\u00e7ois Cars. In 1725 he was commissioned by Jean de Julienne to undertake engravings after Watteau for the <i>Figures de diff\u00e9rents caract\u00e8res de paysages et d'\u00e9tudes</i>. In 1727 he was in Italy with Carle van Loo and on his return in 1731 he became an <i>agr\u00e9e</i> of the Acad\u00e9mie. Three years later he was called to Beauvais to design tapestries and ultimately became Inspector of the Paris Gobelins factory after Oudry's death in 1755. He was a profilic and popular painter, working for Louis XV and Madame de Pompadour. In 1765 he was appointed Director of the Acad\u00e9mie, and <i>Premier Peintre du Roi</i> in succession to Van Loo. \n     Boucher was the most important figure among the second generation of French rococo painters and he exerted considerable influence both in painting and in the decorative arts. \n\n<i>Lit.</i> A Michel, <i>Boucher</i>, 1906; P. de Nolhac, <i>Boucher</i>, 1907. \n\n\nFollower of Fran\u00e7ois BOUCHER \n\n39 \nAIR: THREE PUTTI WITH BIRDS \n<i>Canvas</i> \n34\u00bc x 29\u00bd (86.6 x 74.6) \nJones Bequest \n595-1882\n\nOne of a series of four pictures, of which two are in the Museum (see also no. 40) representing the Elements. The original composition by Boucher was engraved by J. Daull\u00e9 (print in Dept. of Prints & Drawings, 26472.2). The engraving is inscribed: \n                        Jeunes Oiseaux, que la tendresse inspire, \n                        Sortez de nos bois; \n                        Unissez vos voix; \n                        Chantez l'Amour; l'Air est votre empire. \nAccording to the inscription on the print, the original paintings of <i>Air</i> and <i>Earth</i> belonged to the King of France. \n     The engraving is reversed, which suggests that 595-1882 is derived from the original painting and not from the engraving. It differs also from the engraving in minor details, such as the mouth of the central figure and the length and slope of the floating drapery. A version, signed and dated 1741, was exhibited at the R. A., <i>European masters of the 18th century</i>, 1954-55, no. 457 (Collection Arthur Veil-Picard, Paris; oval, 34 x 30). It is identical with the engraving, though in reverse, and is probably the original composition. Like this painting and the engraving, 595-1882 was probably originally oval; the canvas at the upper corners was added at a later date and remains unpainted. The quality of the painting indicates that it was executed in Boucher's studio and not by the master himself. \n\n<i>Condition.</i> Cleaned in 1966; small areas of damage in upper centre; to the left of the lower dove; at the left of the child's knee and at the lower right. \n<i>Prov.</i> John Jones; bequeathed to the Museum in 1882. \n<i>Lit.</i> Long, <i>Cat.

Victoria & Albert Museum, HMSO, London, 1990. p.xix-xx\n\nJohn Jones (1800-1882) was first in business as a tailor and army clothier in London 1825, and opened a branch in Dublin 1840.  Often visited Ireland, travelled to Europe and particularly France.  He retired in 1850, but retained an interest in his firm.  Lived quietly at 95 Piccadilly from 1865 to his death in January 1882.  After the Marquess of Hertford and his son Sir Richard Wallace, Jones was the principal collector in Britain of French 18th century fine and decorative arts.  Jones bequeathed an important collection of French 18th century furniture and porcelain to the V&A, and among the British watercolours and oil paintings he bequeathed to the V&A are subjects which reflect his interest in France.  \n\nSee also <u>South Kensington Museum Art Handbooks.

Pictures,... and other things</u>, p.138, \"The pictures which are included in the Jones bequest are, with scarcely a single exception, valuable and good; and many of them excellent works of the artists.  Mr. Jones was well pleased if he could collect enough pictures to ornament the walls of his rooms, and which would do no discredit to the extraordinary furniture and other things with which his house was filled.\"\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a copy after an oval composition, signed and dated 1741, and formerly in a private collection, New York and sold again at Sotheby's, New York, 23rd June 2003, lot 93 (it may correspond to the version that was exhibited in the Royal Academy in 1954-55, No. 457) (See Ananoff and Wildentsetin, no. 183). \nIt depicts two naked putti petting a dove while a third putto is flying away with another bird. This composition is traditionally interpreted as an allegory of Air and was part of a cycle of four paintings representing the Elements, all four were engraved by Jean Daull\u00e9 in 1748 (see The British Museum, London, 1866,0113.21 and The Victoria and Albert Museum, E.6917-1903). The print is inscribed with the following verses:\nJeunes Oiseaux, que la tendresse inspire, \n                        Sortez de nos bois; \n                        Unissez vos voix; \n                        Chantez l'Amour; l'Air est votre empire.\nAccording to the print, the original painting by Boucher belonged to Louis XV, King of France whereas the print was dedicated by Daull\u00e9 to the Count of Bruhl.\nAnother copy of <i>Air</i> appeared on the Paris art market, 24-25 Sep. 1962 and again in 1971, 1976 and 1979. \nThe cycle is composed of allegories of the other three elements: <i>Earth</i>, Ivens collection, England, <i>Water</i> and <i>Fire</i>, both lost and known only through Daull\u00e9's engravings. The V&A also owns a copy of <i>Fire</i> (596-1882), which forms a pendant with 595-1882.\nCompare with 595-1882, Daull\u00e9's engraving appears in reverse, which suggests that the V&A version was not made after the print but after the original painting. \nThese paintings from Boucher's early career anticipates somehow the pastoral imagery pervaded with putti, mythological figures, shepherds and shepherdesses in idyllic landscapes that would contribute to characterise the Rococo movement, of which Boucher became one of the greatest exponents.",

            "production_note": "", 
            "historical_context_note": "Pastoral is a genre of painting whose subject is the idealized life of shepherds and shepherdesses set in an ideally beautiful and idyllic landscape. These scenes are reminiscent of the Arcadia, the Antique Golden Age that the Roman author Virgil (1St BC) described in the <i>Eclogues</i> and were at the time illustrated on the Roman wall paintings. The pastoral was reborn during the Renaissance, especially in Venice, in the oeuvre of such painters as Titian (ca. 1488-1576) and Giorgione (1477-1510), and gradually evolved over the centuries. In the 17th century in fact, the Arcadian themes were illustrated in the Roman school led by the painter Claude Lorrain (1604-1682) whereas a century later, Antoine Watteau (1684-1721) and his followers forged the new genre of <i>f\u00eates galantes</i>, which appears as a derivation of the pastoral. The pastoral became the hallmark of the Rococo movement in which Fran\u00e7ois Boucher's (1703-1770) elegant eroticism found his true expression. This tradition, which had became an illustration of the carefree aristocratic world, died with the French revolution and was never revived although the celebration of the timeless Mediterranean world in the oeuvre of such painter as Henri Matisse (1869-1954) may be seen as a continuing interest for the theme.",
