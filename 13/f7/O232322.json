The proposed extension comprises a new office and servants range the width of the wing, a connecting corridor to a laundry and kitchen block overlooking the kitchen garden on the west side, and a courtyard with a concave wall on the east with the already built stable block set in the north-east angle.  There are similarities between the east front centre and Vanbrugh's own house at Claremont; however the plan is in Pearce's hand.  Pearce and Vanbrugh could have been involved together at Ashley, with Pearce continuing to work there after Vanbrugh's death in 1726.  Alternatively, Vanbrugh could have initiated the work with Pearce being summoned to continue, complete or extend Vanbrugh's work in 1726.",
