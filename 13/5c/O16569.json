Features firmly hatched in brown and sanguine, with some blue-grey and some white heightening blended over a thick warm carnation ground; hair in pale brown wash, hatched in darker brown with some opaque lights; sleeves in ochre wash with touches of silver and gold; collar in white over grey wash; armour washed and hatched in grey with white lights; the Garter ribbon in blue hatched in darker colour; background a grey wash, blending with sky and clouds in washes of blue and grey gouache to right; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n[Frame] Seventeenth-century silver-gilt oval frame, the slightly convex back of sheet metal and the rim cast and elaborately chased, holding the almost flat glass by its bevelled edge. From the glass, the rim recedes outward and backward to a half-round moulding chased with serrated leaves in relief. From that emerges another, reversed band of similar leaves. A sharp arris and trough is edged by a raised laurel-leaf strip and a recessed nose. The back turns in from this arris in a bolection moulding with an outward pointing band of leaves, like those on the front. From their base rises a vertical plain strip which is rolled into a bezel to secure the back. The hanger is a simple round wire ring on the back, held by a transverse loop that bifurcates into leaf terminals. The convex back is engraved with the reversible cypher of King James II, above the inscription <i>Anno Aetat: 28</i> within an engraved laurel border, bound top, bottom and sides with crossed ties.

            "public_access_description": "The word \u2018miniature\u2019 describes a technique of painting in watercolour rather than the size of a painting. Miniature painting developed as a separate art in the 16th century and in Britain it became predominantly a portrait art.\n\nSamuel Cooper had first set up established his independent miniature practice in London in 1642, the year that civil war broke out and King Charles I abandoned London for the safety of York. Cooper was not untouched personally by the years of war leading to the execution of Charles I in 1649. The poet Alexander Pope, the nephew of Cooper\u2019s wife Christina, wrote that she \u2018had three Brothers, one of whom was kill\u2019d, another died in the service of King Charles\u2019. Professionally, however, Cooper flourished, and during the Commonwealth period he was employed by Oliver Cromwell, the Lord Protector. At the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 Cooper\u2019s reputation as the foremost artist in England secured him the patronage of the returned royal family, to which he responded with an enriched style. His flesh painting became more full bodied, noticeably so to contemporaries such as Samuel Pepys, who thought \u2018the colouring of the flesh to be a little forced\u2019.\n\nToday, albeit with fading, this portrait of the Duke of York does not seem unnaturally sanguine. Overall the effect is less austere than Cooper\u2019s style during the Commonwealth period, the lighting less dramatic and so the relief of the sitter\u2019s features is less marked. Its softer, lighter style, however, does not lessen the dignity and presence of the sitter. The Duke particularly retains a serious reserve appropriate for the second son of the \u2018martyred\u2019 Charles I.",

The first <i>6</i> is visible as a fragment in the margin. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Seventeenth-century silver-gilt oval frame, the slightly convex back of sheet metal and the rim cast and elaborately chased, holding the almost flat glass by its bevelled edge. From the glass, the rim recedes outward and backward to a half-round moulding chased with serrated leaves in relief. From that emerges another, reversed band of similar leaves. A sharp arris and trough is edged by a raised laurel-leaf strip and a recessed nose. The back turns in from this arris in a bolection moulding with an outward pointing band of leaves, like those on the front. From their base rises a vertical plain strip which is rolled into a bezel to secure the back. The hanger is a simple round wire ring on the back, held by a transverse loop that bifurcates into leaf terminals. The convex back is engraved with the reversible cypher of King James II, above the inscription <i>Anno Aetat: 28</i> within an engraved laurel border, bound top, bottom and sides with crossed ties.

(2) \n\nThe miniature is the prime finished version of a portrait type for which Cooper must have had a personal sitting to mark either the return of the Court, or James's secret marriage to Anne Hyde in 1660. \n\nJames Sotheby recorded his purchase of this portrait in his account book for the years 1710-15: \u20181711 / March 6 Pd for king James the 2ds. Picture / when Duke of York Aetat: 28: / a halflength painted by Sam: Cooper in Walter [sic] Colours and / set in gilt Mettal Frame; bought / at Mr Grahams Auction for me by Mr Ja: Seamer 20 Guineas [\u00a3] 21. 1 0 [s.].' (3) \n\nThe Graham sale was at Mr Pelletier's in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, and a partly priced catalogue is in the possession of the Marquis of Ailesbury (4) From the other lots at this sale it is possible to identify Graham firmly as the Richard Graham who was an acquaintance of Vertue and who supplied the latter with information incorporated in the Notebooks. Graham is credited with a variety of publications including <i>A Short Account of the most Eminent Painters, both Ancient and Modern</i> appended to the 1695 edition of Dryden\u2019s du Fresnoy (see Graham 1716). According to Vertue, (5)Richard Graham owned a portrait of Cromwell; he also owned the pastel portrait of Cooper; (6) both were at the sale in March 1711/12. \n\nIt has frequently been suggested that Seamer made this and similar frames for James Sotheby. The evidence derives from an entry referring to a different miniature in the account book' recording payment to Seamer on 21 January 1705/6. 'Pd Mr James Seamer Goldsmith his /bill in full of all accts. \u00a311.7s.9d. / \u00a39.Ss.3d. whereof was for the case, Cristal, & co of Venus by Oliver.\u201d(8) \n\nSince there were fourteen settings of the same type as on the Venus in the Sotheby Collection when it was sold in 1955, all except the <i>James</i> engraved <i>JS</i> on the back, it has seemed right to infer that they were made on Sotheby's instructions. \n\nAgainst this is the fact that although Seamer figures regularly in the accounts as the maker or gilder of mugs, goblets, etc., this is the only entry that refers to the making of a case for a miniature. The record of Sotheby's cash-flow in the years 1705-15 is in fact extremely full, so the negative evidence is significant.(9) Furthermore, the wording of the entry that related to the <i>James</i> suggests that it was already 'set in a gilt Mettal Frame', and the description in the Graham sale catalogue confirms that this was so before Seamer bought it. Significantly perhaps, the <i>James</i> is the only one of Sothebys miniatures framed in this way that does not have the JS monogram on the back. Then there are other miniatures, the Duchess of Orleans by Cooper (Cat. No. 84) and the Mary of Modena at Welbeck Abbey (10) for example, which are not known to have been in Sotheby's collection but which are framed in this distinctive manner. \n\nThe inference should perhaps be that the style was still current among the goldsmiths who undertook such work (including Seamer), but that it dated back to probably the third quarter of the seventeenth century, when the frames on the <i>Henrietta Anne</i> and the <i>James</i> originated. The style is 'certainly anachronistic for 1712' and is absolutely right for c.1660. (11) It is likely that we have here the earliest appearances of the new manner of framing the enlarged miniatures that were beginning to appear, initially in the portraiture of the Court, after the Restoration. The 'Searner' case is, structurally, much more a frame than a locket, and it is clearly intended to be hung in a cabinet rather than worn as a jewel. It is curious, however, that the type seems to have undergone no evolution between c.1660 and c.1705-10 and that Seamer was content to reproduce anachronistic chasing at this extremely high level of quality, even for an antique miniature like the Venus. Presumably Sotheby wanted his miniatures <i>en suite</i>. \n\n1 Repro. Foster 1898, pl. 25 and Foster 1903, vol.I, pI.

Between 1698 and 1717 it was stabilised at this level, and [ames Sotheby made his payments accordingly (20 x 21s.6d. = \u00a321.1 Os.) .The 21s. conversion rate was established in 1717. \n4 Printed by the Historical Manuscripts Commission, 15th Report, Appendix pt vii, (1898), pp. 204-6.\n 5 Vertue I, p. 31. \n6 D91 ; see Cooper biographical note and Cat. No. 77 for further discussion of Graham. \n7 L.2726-1955. \n8 It was unusual for the client rather than the artist to send the completed miniature to the goldsmith for framing. As Pepys records, Cooper sent the completed portrait of Mrs Pepys to the goldsmith for framing, at a charge - additional to the basic \u00a330 for the miniature - of \u00a38.3s.4d.; a figure similar to the \u00a39. Ss. 3d. paid to Seamer by Sotheby. \n9 MSS 1.2 72 6-1 955 and 1.2 72 7-1 955; for the earlier period we depend on extracts from lost originals made by James Sotheby 11l in 1721: Ll721-19 55. \n10 Catalogued by Goulding as the Countess 01 Ogle by Richard Gibson (Goulding 1914-15, no. 163, pI. XIV)  but listed by Vertue as Mary 01 Modena in 1743 and now again accepted as such (see RA 1960-1, no. 683; Foskett 1972, no. 337, pI. 126).Vertue's record of the miniature at Welbeck Abbey in 1743 is very strong presumptive evidence that the miniature was never in the Sotheby Collection. The same presumption applies to the so-called Duke 01 Monmouth by Cross, also at Welbeck (Goulding 1914-15, no. 91, pl. XVI; Foskett 1972, repro. in colour, pI. 33). The longevity of the style is indicated by the use of the frame type for another portrait which has no evident connection with Sotheby, the Field Marshal GeorgeWade by Benjamin Arlaud, signed and dated 1731 (Clarke Collection, formerly Pierpont Morgan, his sale Christies 24 June 1935, lot 457;Williamson 1906-8, vol. 11, no. 186, repro.). \n11 According to John Cooper, written opinion in Museum files.\" ",
