            "public_access_description": "Georgia Russell 'un-makes' books, maps, banknotes, sheet music and other printed materials by finely cutting, folding, and overlaying them and staging them in custom-made acrylic vitrines. She is inspired by psychologist Erich Fromm's observation that a child often destroys a thing in order to understand it, '..takes something apart, breaks it up in order to know it; to force its secret.' In the process of creating new forms from existing ones she also unlocks hidden or potential meanings or suggests new ones. This eerily prescient work came about almost by chance when Russell was making one of her map pieces from a page in an atlas. Having delicately cut away at a map of Britain she turned over the page to discover that, viewed from the other side, she had carved a Britain-in-reverse out of Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan, also overlapping with Russia; Russia had been Britain's rival for imperial influence in the region through much of the 19th century. Weeks after she made this piece the 'coalition' of Western governments, led by America and Britain, invaded Iraq.",
