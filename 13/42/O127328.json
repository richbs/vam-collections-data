He also used ebonised mahogany to suggest an Asian influence, although the settee was also available in natural mahogany. Godwin originally designed the settee for the Earl of Limerick at Dromore Castle, County Limerick in about 1869, and there are several surviving examples. One settee, now in Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, belonged to the actress Ellen Terry, with whom Godwin lived for seven years. Many of Godwin's designs for furniture were manufactured by William Watt and Co., 21 Grafton Street, London, who advertised the settee in their catalogue Art Furniture in 1877, at a price of \u00a310. 10s. 0d (\u00a310-50p).\n\nOn loan to Bodelwyddan Castle, National Portrait Gallery, Rhyl.",
