            "public_access_description": "Joachim Henne (active 1663-1707) was a renowned ivory carver, who worked in Denmark and Northern Germany, specialising in small portrait reliefs and busts. He also executed figure groups, and relief depicting mythological scenes. Comparatively little is known of Henne\u2019s life, including when and where he was born or died, or where he was trained. Although possibly from Jutland or North Germany, he may have trained in South Germany, in Ulm or Augsburg, and was active in Hamburg (1663-5), Gottorf (1665-7), and Copenhagen at the Court of King Frederick III, and then under that of Frederick\u2019s successor, King Christian V, from 1667 until 1691. From 1702-7 he is recorded as court miniature painter at the Brandenburg Court in Berlin, and he is also known to have worked in wood.\n\nThe composition is derived from a print by the Netherlandish artist Crispijn van den Queborn (1604-1652) after Hendrik van Balen of Antwerp (1575-1632). An amber relief in the Museum's collection set into an amber and ivory altar is derived from the same source (inv. no. A.1-1950).",

This is same engraved source as that used for the central relief on a large amber and ivory altar (A.1-1950).\n\nHenne produced this relief while at his time at the court of Copenhagen, and stylistic similarities can be seen with his mythological reliefs in Rosenborg. The fact that is dated implies however that it was made for a private client, rather than for the King, whose ivories were not generally dated. This might also explain why it left Denmark at a later date.",
