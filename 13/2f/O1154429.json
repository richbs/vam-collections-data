Impey believes that by using text, this narrative can become explicit as well.  The inscription on 'Punctuation' is based on a letter that came to light when the artist was searching her mother's belongings following her death.  The letter was kept for many years in a chest of drawers containing bottles of perfume and bath essences, and hints at a former relationship between her mother and a family friend.  In conversation, Impey speaks of the surprise of discovering a hidden, intimate history, stowed away yet treasured amongst personal possessions.  She also notes the enduring power of this story to resurrect itself, its will to survive, and the perpetual allure of the words on the page.\n\nImpey chose two phrases to work with: 'never did like punctuation' and 'see you suddenly one day'. Playing with the myth that women stitched love letters into their quilts, Impey used this letter from a family friend to inspire the rest of the text.",
