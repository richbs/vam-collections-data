The public and most collectors of modern works moved to a preference for lighter and sometimes more sentimental themes.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nIn Cervantes' novel Don Quixote, the adventures of the Don's servant, the lazy, greedy and completely unidealistic Sancho Panza, was the source of many humorous and, to modern tastes, cruel adventures.  Here the gourmand Sancho Panza is shown enduring what was to him a torment. A physician is waving an ivory wand and peremptorily ordering his food to be removed as soon as he has only tasted it.  The Victorian public found this harsh treatment amusing and the effect is increased because Sancho and his surroundings are not caricatured, but could be a recognisable portrait. One reviewer for The Examiner wrote: 'The eyes of Sancho are despairingly fixed on this grim emblem of perpetual disappointment; and the heartsick discontent which his countenance exhibits is infinitely humorous.' \n\nPeople\nAlthough Charles Robert Leslie (1794-1859) had begun as a history and portrait painter, he soon turned to literary themes. The collector John Sheepshanks (1787-1863) owned 17 paintings by Leslie with subjects taken from well-known authors, such as Shakespeare, Chaucer and Moli\u00e8re.",

Apprenticed to a publisher 1808, received a few lessons in painting from Thomas Sully. A subscription was raised to enable him to study art in Europe; returned.to London 1811, entered RA Schools and studied with Benjamin West and Washington Allston. Visited Paris 1817 with Allston and Wilkie Collins, met G S Newton, with whom he visited Brussels and Antwerp. Also friend and biographer (published 1843) of John Constable. Exhibited 76 works at the RA between 1813 and 1859, and 11 at the BI 1815-32. Some were portraits, but most were his much admired literary subjects, particularly drawn from Cervantes, Moliere, Shakespeare and Steme. Elected ARA 1821, RA 1826. Several of his works were engraved, and he made six illustrations for Sir WaIter Scott's Waverley novels 1824. Worked for six months as drawing master at West Point Military Academy, New York State, 1833. Professor of Painting at RA 1848-52; his lectures were published as a <U>Handbook for Young Painters</u> (1855). His <u>Life of Reynolds</u> was finished by Tom Taylor and published 1865. Died St John's Wood, London, 5 May 1859. An exhibition at the RA of  30 of his works was held winter 1870. His two sons, George Dunlop and Robert, were also artists. The <u>Athenaeum </u>critic (9 May 1846, p480) wrote that he was 'unrivalled for the certainty of his powers, the <i>wi</i>t of his pencil, the deep knowledge of human nature as exhibited in the more ordinary scenes of life'.\n\nLIT: <u>Art JournaI</u>1856, pp73-5 and 105-7, 1859, p187 (obit); C R Leslie <u>Autobiographical Recollections</u> ed T Taylor, 2 vols, 1860; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by C R Leslie </u> nd [1875]; <u>Art ]ournaI</u>1902, pp 144-8; J Constable <u>The Letters of John Constable and C R Leslie</u> 1931; ed R B Beckett John <u>Constable's Correspondence</u> III, Ipswich 1965 \n\n\n<b>Sancho Panza</b>\n FA132 Neg V1940 \nPanel, 30.5 X 22.8 cm (12 X 9 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \nExhibited at the RA in 1839, and, according to Taylor (<u>Leslie</u> II, p25l), painted for John Sheepshanks. Taylor also comments (I, pxl) that 'more truthful humour was never put on canvas of the same dimensions by any painter at any period'. The subject is taken from Cervantes's Don Quixote, part 2 chapter 47: \n\nHe took his place at the upper end off the table, which was accommodated with one seat only and a cover for himself alone, while close by to him stood a personage, who afterwards proved to be his physician, with a rod of whalebone in his hand ... A page tucked a bib under Sancho's chin, and another who acted the part of a server, set a plate of fruit before the governor; but scarce had he swallowed a mouthful, when the doctor touching the said plate with his wand, it was snatched from him in a twinkling. \nThe <u>Athenaeum</u> critic described the subject without further comment, while the Art Union thought it 'a capital work'. The <u>Examiner </u>dealt with Leslie's powers of comic expression at some length: \n\nMr Leslie's picture is small, and presents little more than the bust of the great philosopher seated before his unhappy board; his knife and fork sole occupants of the otherwise naked space; and on his face the most comic fractiousness that ever was portrayed. Instead of the common practice, however, of delineating the lugubrious physician, and a sort of <i>pendant</i> of the apothecary in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, merely the hand and black wand of that despotic functionary are introduced in the corner of the picture. The eyes of Sancho are despairingly fixed on this grim emblem of perpetual disappointment; and the heart-sick discontent which his countenance exhibits is infinitely humorous. \nIn a text accompanying an engraving in 1868, the <u>Art Journal</u> analysed the facial expressiveness, concluding that 'all tell the tale most humorously, but with a refinement that only a painter of Leslie's elegant taste would throw into a subject of contrary tendency'. This expressiveness may also be related to the more realistic seventeenth-century re-interpretation of the traditional images of the five senses, in this case of course the sense of taste. The present work may be compared, for example, with Jose de Ribera's painting of about 1612-5 (now Wadsworth Athenaeum, Hartford, Connecticut; repr R Spear<u> Caravaggio and his followers</u> Cleveland Museum of Art, Ohio, exhibition catalogue 1971, p150). \nTaylor notes that '[Sir Francis] Chantrey may have aided Leslie as a model for the expression. But the head was painted, his son George tells me, from the family fly-driver'. A larger version of the subject, described by Taylor as the 'scene in full' <u>(Leslie</u> I, pxl, II, p310), showing other figures including the physician, was painted for Lady Chantrey in 1855 and exhibited that year at the RA. It may possibly have been the work recorded in a private collection in 1969. Leslie had exhibited heads of Sancho Panza and Don Quixote at the BI in 1819. \n\nEXH: \tRA 1839 (125); Victorian Narrative Paintings V&A circulating exhibition 1961 \n\nENGR: J H Baker (repr <u>A Picture Gallery of British Art 1873</u>, facing p40; R C Bell, in <u>Art Journal</u> 1868, facing p56, and J Dafforne <u>Leslie and Maclise</u> 1871, facing p37 \n\nLIT: <u>Athenaeum</u> 25 May 1839, p396; <u>Art Union</u> 1839, p68; <u>The Examiner </u>1839, p359;<u> Leslie</u> I, ppxxxix-xl, II, p251; <u>L'Artiste</u> XX, 1884, p248; E B Chancellor <u>Walks Among London's Pictures </u>1910, pp260-1 \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
