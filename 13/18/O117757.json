Noon 1802</i>. This inscription is repeated in ink in another hand. The last figure in Constable's inscription might be read as '3', but the ink copy is clear. Mr. Harold Day has presented to the collections a hitherto unrecorded engraving of this composition, which he acquired at the sale of the contents of Kentwell Hall, Long Melford, 8 September 1970 (E. 1029-1970). It is lettered: <i>A Mill on the Banks of the River Stour. J. Constable pinxt. J Osborne Fecit. Published by Thos. Thane 1810</i>. There are slight variations from No. 38: a boat with figures has been added on the right, and the line of posts omitted at the bottom might suggest that Constable made an oil painting or watercolour from the drawing.
