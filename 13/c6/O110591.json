Knee-length princess-line ballet dress with short sleeves and boat neck, of off-white panne velvet.  The neck, sleeves and hem are edged with chenille and lurex meshed braid with pearls on both edges.  Around the mix-skirt is a loose band of velvet edged with gold lurex braid; the right side of the skirt is caught up over this revealing the underskirt and fold decorated with a shield surmounted by a crown in silver cloth decorated with pearlised sequins and embroidered fleur de lys.  The top underskirt is of pink silk; four other underskirts, two of fine net and two of stiffer net, are attached to a low waistline.  The dress is scattered with star shaped flower ornaments of copper and pewter coloured plastic.  The costume fastens at the back with hooks and eyes and has eylet holes and lacing.",

The music for the ballet was composed by Tchaikovsky.  This new production, staged by Peter Wright,  was a deliberate attempt to give the ballet a different 'look' from the famous former production designed by Oliver Messel.  New and additional choreography was provided by Frederick Ashton, and the 'Medieval' style sets and costumes were designed by Henry Bardon, Lila de Nobili and Rostislav Doboujinsky.  The production was not considered a success, and was replaced by a new production by Kenneth MacMillan in 1973.",
