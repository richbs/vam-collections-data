            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nSauce boats became an essential item on the British dinner table around 1720, when French-style sauces became popular. English ceramics factories often copied sauce boats from silver ones. Early sauceboats were open boat-shaped vessels with one or two pouring lips, but late-18th-century ones were often tureen-shaped with a central foot. Either type could require an underdish to prevent spillage.\n\nUse\nThe five main sauces introduced by the French were b\u201achamel, brune/espagnol, tomate, mayonnaise and velout\u201a. Gravies made from roasted meat flavoured with wine, citrus juice, capers, herbs and spices were also popular in 18th-century Britain. Other sauces had a 'roux' base, made by combining butter or lard with flour and broth or milk, and flavoured with parsley, onions, celery, anchovies, oysters, cockles or eggs. Butter sauces, served in smaller sauce boats or butter boats, frequently accompanied vegetables. A hot sauce of wine, butter and sugar was the most common one for puddings.\n\nTrading\nSauceboats of this general type are included in a wholesale price list of the London warehouse of the Worcester factory. Blue and white 'Sauceboats, high footed' were sold at 14, 18 and 27 shillings a dozen, according to size. This sauce boat is painted in enamels (a more expensive and laborious technique), and would have cost more.",
