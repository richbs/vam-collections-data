The image has a causal quality to it's photographic style, akin to the qualities of the photographs that we take of our families and friends at social and domestic events.  Goldin's photographs are refering to the intimacy that we can often reach in our amateur photographs but Goldin's contribution to contemporary art photography has been to bring this quality into the public arena of the art world.  In this photograph, printed much larger than snappy snap style embedded in the uneven flash lighting and photographic 'red eye' that we see, Goldin captures an intimate moment, after the couple have, perhaps, argued and now attempt to compose themselves for the camera.",

It is a pictorial journey, documenting, with total candour, Goldin\u2019s \u2018extended family\u2019 of Bohemian friends, drug addicts, transvestites, clubbers and battered lovers. The images are particularly powerful because of the photographer's involvement with her subjects over a 20 year period.",
