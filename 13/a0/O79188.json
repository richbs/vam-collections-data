Across the front of the band are eight circular silver-gilt discs, alternating with seven rectangles with concave sides, all decorated with rings of twisted wire and granules.  These plaques are surrounded with a strip of silver panzer chain.  There are 21 small pendants of silver granule lozenges hanging from the bottom edge of the band.  A pendant is attached at each end of the band which would have hung down at the side of the face.  Each pendant consists of a top piece of three tubes soldered together side by side, with a loop-in-loop chain, ending in a circular disc with twisted wire decoration, attached at each side.  Below this is a rosette of loops, with two more chain pendants, one at each side, and a central crescent, from which are suspended two more pendants of silver tubes and discs with twisted wire decoration.",
