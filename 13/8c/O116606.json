Although the girandole design and its large size are characteristic of Italian traditional jewellery, the size and cut of the emeralds are less common, and it may have been made for fashionable wear.  The original hinged wire of the earring has been replaced with a pendant loop, and a brooch fitting has also been added at the back of the central section to make it more wearable.",
