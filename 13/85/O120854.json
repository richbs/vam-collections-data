However, although its ambitious design includes flowers, landscapes and a medallion with the head of a woman, it is of less good quality than the marquetry on the other pieces. Fran\u00e7ois Bayer may have deliberately copied a style of decoration that had been developed by better known cabinet-makers. \n\nIn 1883, a year after the table had been bequeathed by John Jones, the Museum's handbook identified the medallion head of a woman as 'the late Princess Sophia', the fifth daughter of Louis XV, who died in 1782.  In fact the woman's head is too generalised to be identified, but the romantic wish to link such a table with the pre-Revolutionary French monarchy was typical of collectors and museums in the 19th century.",
