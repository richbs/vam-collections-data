Later it was put up at Christie's (in 1935 \"two or three years ago\") and sold to a \"small dealer\" from whom it was bought back by Mr Burney, who again repaired it and sold it to Mr Goetz.\n\nMr Burney added the manger, the pillar on the right, the column and two angels at the top (one in part only). These are in coloured plastic wax. Acording to Mr Burney the original figures were modelled in clay and moulds made, the moulds were then painted and the eyes inserted and the wax poured in. This took up the colour and the eyes.",
