This would not have been sold as a complete set, and individual parts would have been purchased separately. The majority of the set was manufactured by O & M Hausser, a well-known German company, although at least one of the explosions was produced by a rival company, Lineol, also based in Germany. The bunker and trench segments are made from wood and cardboard, and the soldiers and explosions from a composite material (for which Hausser's used the tradename Elastolin), produced from mixing sawdust, glue, casein and kaolin. This mixture was placed into a mould around a wire armature, then gently heated and dried before being hand-painted. The set reflects the trend amongst toy soldier manufacturers to mirror the real world in terms of new military equipment and modes of warfare.",

At least one of the explosions, and possibly several soldiers, were produced by Lineol, a rival company to Hausser, again based in Germany, it is assumed at a similar period.",
