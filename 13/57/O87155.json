It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years.  Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nBorn in Copenhagen, Carl Brisson began his career as a boxer, fighting to championship level under his real name of Carl Pedersen.  In 1916 he made his first stage appearance as a dancer in Denmark, and a cabaret singer in Sweden.  After touring South Africa as a cabaret singer, he came to London in 1921 and established himself as a great star of musical comedy at Daly's Theatre as Prince Danilo in The Merry Widow (1923). He worked frequently in London and New York; made a great hit at the Savoy Theatre in Wonder Bar (1930), and in 1949 had a one-man show at the London Palladium.  He was knighted in Denmark the same year.",
