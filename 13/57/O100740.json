Background decorated with punched stars. The 'stiff-leaf' palmettes on this boss are somewhat rigidly drawn and the treatment presents little variety. The mid-ribs do not dive into the terminations of the leaves as, for instance, on the misericords at Exeter Cathedral or on the West-Front at Wells Cathedral ('Resurrection' tier). The mid-ribs are not button-shaped either, as at Wells, but elongated. Berries with framing leaves and the palmette device can be seen in stone at Wells Cathedral and Glastonbury Abbey. The somewhat unimaginative and restrictive handling of the foliage suggests the sculpture to be the work of a country craftsman. The juxtaposition of conventional  'stiff-leaf' ornament with naturalistic motifs is reminiscent of the treatment of the Exeter Cathedral misericords of the mid 1240s. The use of punching to produce a decorated background to the carving is a particularly interesting and unusual feature.",

Close-up their carved ornament may look chunky or even crude, whereas in their original position in the roof they would have been seen from far below.
