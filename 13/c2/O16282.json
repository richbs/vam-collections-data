The surviving casts depend from a model by Donatello that is likely to have been produced during his stay at Padua, probably between 1447 and 1453. The weathered condition of the present version suggests that it was also a street Madonna. The model was probably designed specifically for reproduction. The most common variant of the Verona Madonna was produced in large numbers in terracotta.",

It was a very popular design in the fifteenth century and numerous copies of this relief survive (with slight variations) in terracotta, stucco, and wood. \n\n The V&A relief is identical to the one in Verona, and has a weathered surface, suggesting that it too was originally a street madonna.  They are both made from stucco which was a durable but relatively cheap material; the casts could be made in large numbers and were often painted.  \n\n'Street madonnas' like this were devotional objects but were also thought to offer protection to the neighbourhoods over which they looked.
