The locket packed out with cut playing cards. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b>Acquired by the Hon. F H A Wallop from an unrecorded source, and lent to the Museum 1927-49; the ownership transferred to Alan Evans in 1933 and by him bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.) \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> RA 1934, no. 957. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Long 1929, p.128 ('an excellent Signed miniature of a man in armour'); Foskett 1979, p. 130, fig. 27a (dated c.1663); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 16 (as <i>Duke of Albemarle</i>); Murdoch 1981 p. 154, fig. 164 (as <i>Unknown Man</i>, c.1660). \n\nThe miniature was identified by Wallop as a portrait of the 1st Duke of Albemarle (1608-1670), whose pre-Restoration portraiture is an uncertain subject. Long was sceptical and responded more favourably to a suggestion from Allan Fea that the sitter was Colonel John Lane, copied from a Cooper miniature that was reproduced in a book called <i>The Flight of the King</i>. (1) Neither suggestion seems satisfactory. Colonel Lane of Bentley Hall was the brother of the famous Jane Lane who helped Charles II to escape from the Battle of Worcester in September 1651. She rode pillion behind him through the Parliamentary lines near Stratford-upon-Avon and conducted him eventually in safety to Dorset. Her brother would have been a typical candidate in the nineteenth century for the optimistic identification of anonymous sitters. The supposed Cooper original is no longer extant. \n\nAs for Albemarle, the standard images are the two Coopers of c.1660, the 'sketch' at Windsor, without the Garter ribbon conferred on him in 1660, (2) and the finished portrait with the Garter in the Buccleuch Collection; (3) the Lely in the 'Flagmen' series of c.1665; (4) and the miniature derivative, Anon., Cat. No.198. Judging by the sitter's apparent age, this miniature would have to be considerably earlier than any of these images, but to be by Dixon it cannot be earlier. Dixon must have been born c.1645, and the miniature, as a Signed and already accomplished work, cannot plausibly be dated before 1660, and preferably even later. \n\n1 1897; MS note by Fea preserved in Evans Loan Book and transcribed in the Chrisrie's valuation of 1969, both Department of Prints, Drawings and Paintings. \n2 Foskett 1974, fig. 67. \n3 Kennedy 1917, pl.
