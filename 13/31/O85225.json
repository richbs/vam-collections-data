ISBN 1851773088.\nThe explicit educational use of the collection is documented in an engraving published in The Illustrated London News for 5 March 1870, showing a \"Lecture to working men on ornamental ironwork at the South Kensington Museum\", in which this particular cresting is one of the works illustrated (see fig.69), The cresting formed part of a collection on ornamental ironwork that was already extensive by 1870. The lecture was one of a series of six given in 1870 by a Mr Capes, of Balliol College, Oxford and the lecture notes reveal the way in which the Museum's mission to improve design and manufacture was presented. The \"unsatisfactory condition\" of the iron working industry is blamed on \"the want of a class of highly skilled artisans... the debasement of public taste, and still more in the substitution of the system of casting iron for the higher process of forging\". This prejudice against cast iron (made by pouring molten iron into a mould), which was ideal for mass production, is reflected in the collection, which focused almost exclusively on wrought iron until the 1930s.\n\nCrestings such as this were a common element of ironwork gates and screens and provided an opportunity for an elaborate display of the blacksmith's skill. Ironwork of this type is very rarely dated; once a piece has been removed from its context the only means of attribution is stylistic. The scrolled foilage has a Baroque exuberance despite its delicacy, which, combined with the quality of the workmanship, make the cresting typical of the ironwork of South Germany.\n\nLit.
