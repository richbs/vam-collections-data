Western pilgrims to the Holy Land frequently passed through Cyprus, and the Cypriot goldsmiths absorbed influences from Western Europe as well as Ottoman Turkey.  Their work is similar to jewellery from elsewhere in the region, but the quality is often higher.  They were famous for their filigree, often enriched with blue and green enamels.\n\nThis disc would have been worn by a woman, sewn to the top of a little cap, like a fez, in the Ottoman style.  It was called a tepeliki, from a Turkish word meaning \u2018little mound\u2019.  Similar ornaments were worn throughout the territories of the former Ottoman Empire, but few were as sophisticated as this.  The delicate green filigree enamel is typical of Cypriot work.  The striated corals are characteristic of Saphrampolis, in northern Anatolia, and were exported throughout the Ottoman region.",
