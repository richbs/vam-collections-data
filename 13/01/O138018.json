Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nThe most popular necklace was a choker, made of several chains fastened at the front with a large decorative snap-clasp.  These are often decorated with filigree and coloured pastes. Swedish traditional jewellers made lavish use of coloured glass.  Red was the most popular colour, as everywhere in Europe, but Swedish women were also fond of a clear blue which is rare elsewhere.  \n\nThe clasp on this necklace is marked with the griffin mark of Ystad, the date letter Q3, for 1822, and the maker's mark IPL.  J\u00f6ns Petter Larsson was a silversmith who worked in Ystad from 1817 to 1832.  There is also a scratched number 12.",
