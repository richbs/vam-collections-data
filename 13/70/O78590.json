The interlaced strapwork design radiating around the central well is likely inspired by Venetian-Saracenic work, including as it does the Islamic asymmetrical knot motif. William Beckford (1760-1844) was fascinated by the Islamic world. He owned a large number of pieces described as being 'Persian', which were probably from Islamic Spain or Venice.  The strapwork on the border of this piece, however, appears entirely European in style and may be based on a late 16th- or early 17th-century print source.\n\nPeople\nThis dish was probably designed by Gregorio Franchi (1770-182 ), Beckford's Portuguese companion and agent. Beckford commissioned the London silversmiths Samuel Whitford II and William Burwash to make the piece.\n\nOwnership & Design\nAs a reflection of William Beckford's obsession with his lineage, heraldic elements formed an important part of the decoration of many of the pieces in his collection. The Douglas mullet, the Latimer cross and the Beckford martlet interwoven in the strapwork pattern are engraved on the dish, while the Hamilton cinquefoil decorates the inner border.  Heraldic motifs adorn much of Beckford's silver and formed an important part of the interior decoration of his home, Fonthill Abbey, Wiltshire.",
