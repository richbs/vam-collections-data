Upper: as lower with max. length 53.5 cms).\n\nWhere the fringe begins at the top and bottom, a red and green plaited braid has been sewn on.  It is long enough to extend on either side; lower has 41 cms extension and upper has max 48 cms.\n\nDESIGN: Field: cream plain weave ground with long sequences of piled motifs, sometimes flowering plants and sometimes geometrical, and sometimes a combination, all symmetrical along a central axis.  These sequences are separated by rectangular panels with similar but smaller motifs.  The extreme end panels are diapered with small stylised trees and blossoms.  They end with 3 bands of geometric motifs woven with weft floating over the warp-faced ground.\n\nBorders: three narrow borders enclose all but the end panels.  The central border has a four-coloured zigzag; the outer is diagonal blocks; the inner is like the outer except for occasional sections of interlocking Y-motifs.\n\nDate catalogued: 24.4.96",
