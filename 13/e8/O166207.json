            "public_access_description": "This panel representing the Virgin and Child, is possibly made by the Master of the Marble Madonnas, in Florence in the second half of the 15th century.\n\nThe Virgin in three-quarter length, is seated against a background of cloud and supports the Child on her left knee. He holds a bird in his left hand and raises his right hand in benediction. In the upper corners are two naked putti flying downwards, each blowing a trumpet. Above the Child's left shoulder is a cherub head.\n\nImages of the Virgin and Child were found in virtually every noble household in 15th-century Florence. They acted as a focus for personal devotion and were thought to protect the family from harm.\n\nThe Master of the Marble Madonnas worked in Tuscany, in the centres of Florence, Arezzo, Pistoia, Camaldoli and others. The Master of the Marble Madonnas is very likely of Tuscan origin, possibly trained in the shop of Mino da Fiesole and strongly influenced by Antonio Rossellino, who later worked in Urbino and its neighbourhood. In this respect his style runs parallel with that of Domenico Rossellini. Not all the works currently ascribed to the Master of the Marble Madonnas are necessarily by one hand. The activity of the Master of the Marble Madonnas may be conjecturally dated in the bracket 1470-1500.",
