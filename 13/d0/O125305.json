Verdi based his opera on the play Le Roi s'Amuseby the French author Victor Hugo, featuring the hunchback Triboulet.  Although the play was banned in France after its first performance, Verdi and his librettist Francesco Piave changed the name of the hunchback to Rigoletto, made the king of the title into a Duke, changed the setting to 16th century Mantua, and wrote an opera which was immediately well-received, unlike Hugo's play. Later re-named Rigoletto by Verdi, it has become one of his best-known and most frequently revived operas.\n\nThis porcelain figurine was made in Italy in the 20th century and produced as an ornament for the mass market, the brightly painted gilt touches and the jaunty air of the figure losing the menace of the character in its portrayal.",
