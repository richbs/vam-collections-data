Circular.</i>\nP.26-1942\n\nTransferred from the British Museum\n\n<i>Note:</i> According to tradition this miniature was painted by Federigo Zuccaro (1542/3-1609) and represents Mary, Queen of Scots. It is alleged to have been given to her by her cousin, Lord John Hamilton, son of the second Earl of Arran, and to have been preserved in the family until the death, in 1743-4, of Elizabeth, widow of the fourth Duke of Hamilton, after which it is said to have been inadvertently sold by auction. A Mr. Maddison, who had been page to the fourth Duke of Hamilton, is stated to have bought the miniature at the sale. How much of the above is true, or how much actually relates to No. P.26-1942, is uncertain. What does, however, appear certain is that the present miniature was sold by Maddison to Sir William Hamilton (1730-1803) - the husband of Emma, Lady Hamilton - as being the supposed original portrait by Zuccaro, and that it was given by Sir William Hamilton to his sister, Elizabeth, Countess of Brooke and Warwick, who presented it to the British Museum in 1792. The present miniature agrees exactly with an etching, dated 1645, by W. Hollar, and may have been based upon it. According to L. Cust (<i>Notes on the authentic portraits of Mary Queen of Scots</i>, 1903, p. 144) Hollar's engraving is an \"improved\" and embellished adaptation from an engraved medallion, dated 1578, in Bishop Lesley's <i>History of Scotland</i>.'\n\n'",
