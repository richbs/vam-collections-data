Aldrich, who topped the bill at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley, during the week of 17 October 1904. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nAldrich transformed himself on stage into the characters Bill Sikes and the Chinese conjuror, who are both in the caricature. He also performed magic tricks, such as disappearing from behind a screen on stage and reappearing seconds later in the first circle of the auditorium.\n\nBorn in Ohio in 1872, Aldrich first appeared in London at the Palace Theatre in May 1898 and later at the Alhambra. In 1901 he was in The Girl Up There on Broadway and in London. He subsequently performed at the Empire, at most of London\u2019s leading halls, and on the provincial circuit. In 1912 he appeared in the first Royal Variety Command performance with his quick-change act and his \u2018eccentric humorous juggling\u2019. Aldrich was on the bill in Hanley with The Three Meers, who were also drawn by Cooke.",

            "history_note": "This caricature is of Charles T. Aldrich, the American quick-change artist, juggler and comedian, appearing at The Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley, during the week of 17th October 1904.  Born in Ohio in 1872, Aldrich made his first appearance in London at the Palace Theatre in May 1898 and subsequently at London's Alhambra music hall and at halls in the provinces.  In 1901 he appeared in 'The Girl Up There' at the Duke of York's Theatre after which he appeared at the Empire and at most of London's leading halls and on the provincial circuit. In 1912 he was on the bill of the first Royal Variety Command Performance at the Palace Theatre, 1 July 1912 with his quick-change and eccentric juggling act. The caricature comes from the first of several albums compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke, featuring performers working in music hall in the early 20th century.  The album is dated 1903-4-5.",
