One of his polychromed wood versions of the same subject dating from about 1633 is on an altarpiece in the Church of Santa Clara, Seville.\nMonta\u00f1\u00e9s was a Spanish sculptor trained in Seville, but also spent some time in Granada, probably working under Pablo de Rojas in about 1579. Popularly known as 'el dios de la madera' (the god of wood), he executed wood sculpture which is remarkable for its technical brillance. He also perfected a number of iconographical types which became seminal images.\nLead has bean mined in the area of Seville since Roman times; the tradition of lead sculpture in Seville along with other stylistic comparisons imply that the piece must have been made in the city.\nThe downward glance and the lack of finish on the top of the head indicate that this piece was intended to be seen from a low viewpoint.",
