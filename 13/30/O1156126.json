He is dressed in a red and gold tunic over which he wears armour, consisting of a breastplate and round shield. He is also carrying a spear. The lion is rearing up on it's hind legs and is fastened to the chariot, however it does not appear to be particularly ferocious as it this fastening consists of a garland of flowers. \n\nA note on the rear of the print suggests that Carter's act was performed at Astley's Amphitheatre in 1839. This amphitheatre was located in Westminster Bridge, near Lambeth. It was opened in circa 1773 by Philip Astley (closing down briefly after a fire in 1794). The amphitheatre mixed circus with theatre, having a circus ring attached to a stage and was renowned for its historical military and equestrian dramas, which it continued to produce until its destruction in 1895.  \n\nTinsel prints were created from etched portraits of theatrical stars in popular roles they played on the London stage. They were hand-painted in watercolour and decorated with scraps of material and tinsel additions. They were popular during the first half of the 19th century and were considered an adult, rather than a child's hobby. By the 1830s it was possible to buy the tinsel, leather and feather ornaments to go with each image.",
