In this painting he is shown holding a work of sculpture; a bas-relief of a nude woman in the classical style.\n\nThe artist of this painting is unknown but it is in the style of the painter, writer and collector Jonathan Richardson who was a leading London portraitist in the early eighteenth century. His style was described by Sir Joshua Reynolds as \u2018cold and hard\u2019 and is considered better suited to male than female sitters.",
