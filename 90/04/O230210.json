The selvedges are red and white. One edge is rather worn and has been repaired in the past by attaching strips of green grosgrain ribbon to the back.\n\n<b>Weave analysis</b> (Lisa Monnas, 2009) \nFigured cut velvet, single harness, satin ground weave (d\u00e9cochement 3) by 1 and 2 picks, 1 looped brocaded weft bound in 1/4 S-twill (by 1 out of 3 yarns of the main warp, <i>liage repris</i>).\n\n<i>Warps</i>. 6 main warps, 1 pile warp.

The thriving trade between the Mongolian Empire and Europe throughout the 14th century brought large quantities of Chinese luxury goods to northern Italy. Chinese silks influenced Italian textile design, particularly in Lucca and Venice. In this piece the rosettes surrounded by cloud-like ribbons with two tiny pomegranate buds at the ends closely resemble the cloud-like motifs, from the Han Dynasty.\n\nThe Visconti and Sforza dynasties (of 15th and 16th-century Milan) often used clouds with other devices, such as the Dog, the Axe, or the Rainbow. The inifinite knot motif was popular throughout the Po Valley in the second half of the 15th century, and appears in many illuminated manuscripts from Lombardy.",
