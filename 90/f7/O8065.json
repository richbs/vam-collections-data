It was originally meant to have a domed oval cover to protect the food and keep it warm.\n\nOwnershp & Use\nThe 'Frog Service' was a 50-person set intended for dinner and dessert. Catherine the Great bought it for her Gothic summer palace built in a frog marsh some miles outside St Petersburg -- hence the inclusion of the frog motif. The service was painted with a total of 1222 views of British landscapes, antiquities and gardens. It cost \u00a32,290 and was intended for occasional use, not for display alone. In the event this particular dish was not sent to Russia, probably because it was replaced by one with a more interesting view.\n\nSubject Depicted\nWedgwood's partner Thomas Bentley selected the views to go onto the service. This one shows the gardens at West Wycombe, Buckinghamshire,  which were laid out by Sir Francis Dashwood in 1739-1752. The painter copied the view from an engraving by William Woollett (1735-1785).",
