            "public_access_description": "Henry Wilson was one of the outstanding metalworkers to have emerged from the ranks of the architects who turned to the practice of the crafts in the late 19th century.  His interest in metalwork started when he was chief assistant to the architect J.D. Sedding.  Apart from his jewellery, Wilson was chiefly famous for his Byzantinizing ecclesiastical work. A representative selection was included in the exhibition of Victorian Church Art at the Victoria and Albert Museum (1971).  He deigned comparatively few pieces of domestic silver, but he made two chafing dishes at about the same time, showing one at the Ghent exhibition of 1913 (catalogue number 1020) and at the Paris Exhibition of British Decorative Arts held in 1914 (catalogue number 806).  Guthlac Wilson, Henry Wilson's son, lent one of the two dishes to the exhibition, Victorian and Edwardian Decorative Arts, 1952 which was subsequently acquired by the Goldsmiths' Company.",
