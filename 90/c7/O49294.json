Such dishes were the most impressive pieces of a dinner service, as they were intended for the most expensive course in a dinner of many courses.\n\nSocial class\nThis dish has a bold, skilfully drawn and naturalistic decoration of an iris. This has been printed, but is enriched with gilding. The gilding, combined with the prestigious name of Josiah Wedgwood & Sons as the maker, would have made the dish attractive to the newly prosperous middle class.\n\nMaterials & Making\nPearlware is a type of earthenware introduced by Josiah Wedgwood & Sons in 1779 as an improvement to its 'Queen's Ware' (creamware).  This new body included a greater proportion of flint and white clay, and the glaze contained a trace of cobalt oxide which gave the body a bluish-white colour. This meant it looked similar to the more expensive bone china, a form of porcelain. Eventually technology improved so that the body itself was whiter, and no longer needed the bluish glaze to enhance it. Like other factories, Wedgwood maintained a hierarchy of patterns, bodies and shapes. 'Best' patterns were usually printed on 'Best' shapes made from a 'Pearl' body and dipped in a 'Pearl' glaze. The word 'Pearl' or the letter 'P' was often impressed into Pearlware pieces.",
