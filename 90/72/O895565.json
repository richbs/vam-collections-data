It was made by the famous cartographer Frederick de Wit as a part of his series of townscapes first published in the 1690s.  The city itself recedes with perspective into the background whilst in the foreground a detail of a rural poor family is contrasted with a wealthy group of individuals headed toward the town on horseback.  This vignette is intended to give a feel of the character of the city more than any plan of streets could do alone.   The coats of arms of the city of Prague and the Kingdom of Bohemia are atop the scene and the translation of the blurb at the bottom into 4 different languages hints at the multi-national audience de Wit was targeting.  These prints were for armchair travelers and traders and not supposed to be used to guide oneself around a town.",
