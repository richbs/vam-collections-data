            "physical_description": "Carpet with a red ground divided into four rectangles each containing tree-like motifs. There are two bands at the bottom, one in red and the other in blue, with branching stems. The central border of an undulating floral stem is bordered with white and green geometric shapes. The central band is repeated down each side sandwiched between two white ground borders and four guard stripes.\n\nWARP: white wool; Z2S; 18 threads per inch (70 per dm).\n\nWEFT: dark brown wool; Z-spun, unplied, 2 parallel threads per shoot; 2 shoots after every row of knots; 16 threads per inch (60 per dm).\n\nPILE: wool; 8 colours: dark red, red, light orange, dark green, dark blue, blue, black, white; symmetrical knot tied around 2 threads; 144 knots per sq. inch (2100 per sq. dm).\n\nSIDE FINISH: one cord oversewn with red wool.\n\nEND FINISH: Lower: max 3 cms. plain weave. Immediately below the pile are 2 passes of red/blue weft-twining and then a narrow band of plain weave with cream weft and the remainder in white. A fringe of warp loops (max. 13.5 cms) long has been made by grouping 8 warp threads and twisting them.  At the extreme right there are some single warp knots, but these may have been made later. Upper: 2 passes red/green wool weft-twining and 2.5 cms. plain weave with dark red weft and 1 cm. with white weft. Single knotted warp fringe max. 8 cms. long . It has been re-warped and knotted for approximately 15. cms. in the centre.\n\nDESIGN: Field: the field is divided into four compartments, the lower two are square and the upper are rectangular. They have a dark red ground with dark blue and dark green shrub-motifs outlined with red; dark blue and dark green alternate to form diagonal bands. Along the central inner sides of all four panels are half hexagons enclosing three dark green triangles on a white ground (5 in the lower panels and 8 in the upper). The band across the middle and above the panels are decorated with diamonds containing crosses on a red ground. A white border encloses the 4 panels on three sides; the vertical borders contain a central pole with dark red, red, dark green and dark blue 'butterfly'-shaped flowers (the horizontal borders do not have the central pole). This border is repeated as an outer border along the top and down the sides as far as the lower band of the elem.\n\nGuard stripes: dark red ground with coloured diagonal blocks. This appears between the borders and as short vertical lines between the diamonds of the central bands and also in the main stem throughout the main border.\n\nMain border: along both sides and dividing the panels down the centre, but not running the entire length, stopping above the elem. It has a red ground with an angular meander with a curled leaf.\n\nElem: total depth: 38 cms. divided horizontally in two. The upper part with a dark red ground lies between outer borders; the lower part with a blue ground, stretches the whole width of the carpet. Both halves have the same design - a vertical stem (as in the guard stripe) bearing 3 pairs of jagged leaves in various colours. Nine of them outlined in black are on the red ground and 11 outlined in red are on the blue ground; tiny triangles and small 5-sided motifs are scattered across the elem.\n\nApron: blue ground (check depth) with 'tree of life' motif.",
