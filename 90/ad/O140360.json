The page is written on both sides, the sides being divided into two square compartments of red each enclosing a block of text on the side with text only, and one compartment on the front side alongside a smaller one to accommodate the illustration. The subject of the picture concerns the early life of the Jina Mahavira, last of the twenty-four Jain tirthankaras or great spiritual teachers (believed to have died in 528 BC). This folio shows the antelope- or goat-headed god Harinaigameshin removing the foetus of Mahavira from the womb of the Brahmani Devananda.",

            "public_access_description": "The Kalpasutra (Book of Rituals) is the most important canonical text in Jain literature for the Svetambaras (white-clad), one of the two sects of Jainism.  Jainism is one of the oldest religions to have survived until the present time and its basic teaching is one of non-violence.  The Kalpasutra is divided into three sections.   The first section deals with the lives of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirthankaras, who were the Jain spiritual teachers or 'ford-makers'.  The second part deals with the life of Mahavira, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara.  The third part deals with rules for the ascetics and laws during the four months (chaturmas) of the rainy season, when ascetics temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst the laity. This is the time when the festival of Paryushan is celebrated and the Kalpasutra is traditionally recited.\nThe subjects of the pictures deal mainly with the early life of Mahavira. In this folio Harinaigameshin, the antelope- or goat-headed divine general,  has descended from the chief god Indra's heaven to the town of Kundagrama, and is removing the foetus of Mahavira from the womb of the Brahmani Devananda. Mahavira's embryo was to be transferred from the Brahmani Devananda's womb to that of Trishala, the Kshatriya woman who was to give birth to him. Brahmans are the hereditary priestly estate, while Kshatriyas were traditionally warriors or rulers.",
