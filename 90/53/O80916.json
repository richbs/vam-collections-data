They would probably have been displayed on matching pedestals on a domestic mantelpiece. Small vases on pedestals were also set out on dining tables during the dessert course of grand meals, although such vases were usually unglazed. A Derby sale of 1771 included 'four curious small antique vases and pedestals for a dessert', which realized \u00a31 12s.\n\nPeople\nThe Neo-classical sculptor John Bacon (1740-1799) may have designed these vases and their pedestals. He was paid the remarkably large sum of \u00a3104 for models by William Duesbury, the owner of the Derby factory, between 1769 and 1771.\n\nTrading\nThe Derby factory aimed at the top end of the market and sold much of its output from factory showrooms in London's Covent Garden. These were handsomely fitted out, and sales were not confined to dealers, but were directed to private customers as well.  The factory also held auctions in London and had agents elsewhere, notably at Bath. One London auction of 1773 included a pair of vases similar to these. They were described as 'a pair of curious antique urns and pedestals' with goat's-head handles and gilding, and realized nearly \u00a310.  At that time, Chelsea and Derby modellers earned around \u00a32 11s. per week.",
