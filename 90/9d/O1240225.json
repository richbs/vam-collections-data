            "public_access_description": "This game was hand made by the donor's aunt, Miriam Pratt when she was a student at Darlington Training College in the 1930s. Its design is similar to Snakes and Ladders in style, with a game board of 100 squares and several ladders to advance you to a further space, but no snakes to take you down and reverse your ascent. Many of the squares have been illustrated and watercolour painted with scenes from Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit tales, which the game was named after. The five playing pieces represent characters from Peter Rabbit's family, including Mrs Josephine Rabbit, Peter himself, Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail. A hand made box was also created in which to keep the pieces together. \n\nPeter Rabbit was created by Beatrix Potter in 1893, but was not published until 1902. After some trepidation on the behalf of the publishers she approached, The Tale of Peter Rabbit eventually sold 28,000 copies in its first year, with over 150 million copies sold worldwide by 2011. In 1903, Potter designed a Peter Rabbit board game (quite dissimilar to this one) and soft toy, both of which were patented, making Peter Rabbit the first licenced character ever to be merchandised.",
