In 1917 Rietveld set up a furniture workshop in Utrecht which allowed him to make furniture according to his own judgement and taste. In 1918 he designed an unpainted armchair, of which he produced a coloured version in red, blue, yellow and black probably not before 1923. Known as the \u2018Red\u2013Blue\u2019 chair, it brought him international fame.\n\nRietveld became affiliated with Functionalist architecture and participated in the Congr\u00e8s International d\u2019Architecture Moderne (CIAM). From the late 1920s and during the 1930s he concentrated on designing mass-produced furniture and architecture. He executed a number of shop renovations for the Dutch company Metz & Co., who between 1930 and 1955 produced his furniture, including various models of the \u2018Zig-zag\u2019 chair and the so-called \u2018Crate\u2019 furniture. \n\nIn this design for a showroom display in Amsterdam, Rietveld displays his interpretation of space; use of levels and furniture groupings define the space, and the boundary between internal and external space is blurred by the large glass shop-window.",
