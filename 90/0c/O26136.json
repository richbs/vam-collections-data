Two players have each nine men of different colours.  The obejct of the game is to form rows of three pieces of the same colour, without the intervention of your opponent's men.  The first player places a piece on any one of the angles, when his antagonist immediately puts another piece on any angle that may appear likely to prevent the row being formed.  As soon as a row be formed, the player who succeeds in making it removes one of his opponent's men and he who first succeeds in taking all the opposite men but two wins the game.  The men may be placed on any of the angles of the lines and be move backwards, forwards or diagonally; but as soon as a row is formed, it must remain; but one piece may belong to two or three rows; any of the corner pieces of the squares being capable of forming parts of three rows.",
