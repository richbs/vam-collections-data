The back of the painting is signed 'Carl Schmid 1821', so the maker may have been another cabinet-maker of the same name, who worked in Prague in about 1820 and subsequently moved to Vienna. \n\nAn inscription inside the drawer indicates that this mirror was probably sold by a cabinet-maker named Damm in Paris. It is likely that he was a merchant in small luxury items: many such dealers had shops in the arcades of the Palais Royal in Paris, and such dealers made a speciality of selling items veneered in mother-of-pearl.\n\nBalthasar Wigand, who painted the view of St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna on the reverse of the mirror, specialised in gouache views of famous Viennese sites and buildings.",

However, another cabinet-maker of the same name is known to have worked as a journeyman in Prague around 1820 and then in Vienna, which makes a definite attribution difficult.\n\nTwo cabinet-makers called Damm are listed in Paris between 1835 and 1861, but none as early as 1821, and neither in the rue Fourneaux",
