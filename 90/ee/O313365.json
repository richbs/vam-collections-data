This would therefore be an extremely early example of such a scene, although the Arthurian legends were increasingly popular after the middle of the 12th century. The plaque (and a casket in the British Museum) seem to anticipate the 'Minnek\u00e4stchen' and Romance caskets of the 14th century and might indicate an early taste for secular objects of this type.",

This would therefore be an extremely early example of such a scene, although the Arthurian legends were increasingly popular after the middle of the 12th century. The plaque (and a casket in the British Museum) seem to anticipate the 'Minnek\u00e4stchen' and Romance caskets of the 14th century and might indicate an early taste for secular objects of this type.",
