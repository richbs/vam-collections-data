Doges of Venice were elected for life by the city-state's aristocracy. The identification of the sitter with Doge Pasquale Cicogna is supported by the presence of a stork in the pattern of his cloak (see right shoulder). A stork, or cicogna in Italian, was Doge Pasquale's personal emblem, visible for example on the coat of arms included in a portrait engraving by Jacopo Tintoretto (Bartsch XVI.105.1).  The sitter can also be identified through comparison with Palma Giovane's paintings on canvas ca. 1568-87 in the Oratory of the Ospedaletto dei Crociferi, Venice, of the major events in the Doge's life.1449-1882 appears to have been painted by an artist familiar with the works of Jacopo Tintoretto (1519-1594) and his son Domenico (1560-1635) as well as Palma Giovane (ca, 1548-1628) and may be a direct contemporary copy of an unidentified portrait of the Doge by one of these Venetian artists all working on the terra firma in the late 16th century.",

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 291-292, cat. no. 363.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nVenetian School, late 16th century \n\n363\nA VENETIAN DOGE, (?) PASQUALE CICOGNA (1509-95) \nCanvas \n54 \u00bd  X 42 (138.5 X 106.7) \n1449-1882 \n\nThe tentative identification of Pasquale Cicogna, who was doge 1585-95, was suggested by Sir Karl Parker (written communication, 1961). The face and beard fit with the engravings of Cicogna reproduced in L. Matina, <i>Ducalis regia latarium</i>, Venice, 1659, p. 286 and in G. A. Palazzi, <i>Fasti Ducales ab Anafesto I ad Silvestrum Valerium Venetorum Ducem</i>, Venice, 1969, p. 235. Oil paintings described as '?Cicogna' by Palma Giovane (Enyedy sale, Ernst Museum, Budapest, 15 Feb. 1923, lot 486, pl. xx) and Domenico Tintoretto (Hermitage, Leningrad) show similar features, as does another, ascribed to Jacopo Tintoretto (Marquess of Bute collection, exh. New Gallery, 1894-5, no. 231). Niccolo da Ponte (doge 1578-85) is another possibility, but from the available evidence Pasquale Cicogna is the most plausible identification. \nThe painting appears to be a copy, probably contemporary, of a portrait by Palma Giovane or Domenico Tintoretto, both of whom portrayed Cicogna (A. di Mosto, <i>I Dogi di Venezia nelle vita pubblica e private</i>, Milano, 1960, p. 311). \n\nProv. Miss Margaret Coutts Trotter; given to the Museum in 1882.",

In the ancient period, profile portraits were found primarily in imperial coins. With the rediscovery and the increasing interest in the Antique during the early Renaissance, artists and craftsmen looked back to this ancient tradition and created medals with profile portraits on the obverse and personal device on the reverse in order to commemorate and celebrate the sitter. Over time these profile portraits were also depicted on panel and canvas and progressively evolved towards three-quarter and eventually frontal portraits. These portraits differ in many ways from the notion of portraiture commonly held today as they especially aimed to represent an idealised image of the sitter and reflect therefore a different conception of identity. The sitter\u2019s likeness was more or less recognisable but his particular status and familiar role were represented in his garments and attributes referring to his character. The 16th century especially developed the ideal of metaphorical and visual attributed elaborating highly complex portrait paintings in many formats including at the end of the century full-length portraiture. Along with other devices specific to the Italian Renaissance such as birth trays (deschi da parto), wedding chest decorated panels (cassoni or forzieri), portrait paintings participated to the emphasis on the individual.",
