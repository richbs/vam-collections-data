London: Published by Trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1987.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"Sir William N. P. NICHOLSON (1872-1949)\nQueen Victoria's Coachman\nSigned on the mount William Nicholson\nWoodcut coloured by hand\n25.7 X 23.1cm\nE.3592-1913\nGiven by Lady Stern\nLit: William Weston Gallery, <i>Sir William Nicholson</i>, London 1976 and the Maclean Gallery, <i>William Nicholson Woodcuts and Lithographs</i>, London 1981.\n\nWilliam Nicholson was a painter whose remarkable contribution to printmaking was mostly concentrated in a few years at the beginning of his career.  Prior to his first attempts at printmaking, he was involved in the design of posters in partnership with his brother-in-law, James Pryde, under the adopted name of the Beggarstaff Brothers.  Characteristic of Nicholson's graphic work are areas of flat colour, strong outlines, and an acute sense of the shape a single figure will make on a page.  In this, he was closer to the French post-impressionist graphics of Toulouse-Lautrec, Felix Vallotton or August Lep\u00e8re, which he might have seen when he visited Paris in 1889, than to any English tradition.\nNicholson's original single sheet prints such as the well known <i>Queen Victoria</i> 1897 were woodcuts which he coloured by hand himself, but he was taken up by the publisher William Heinemann who commissioned most of his subsequent graphic work and issued it to a much wider audience in the form of colour lithographs.  Nicholson's work for Heinemann included <i>An Alphabet, An Almanac of Twelve Sports</i> and <i>London Types</i> all in 1898.\nAll three were published in deluxe, Library and Popular editions.  The deluxe edition consisted of woodcuts coloured by hand and the Library and Popular editions of colour lithographs printed on different quality papers and bindings.  Nicholson was paid sixpence a sheet for hand-colouring the deluxe edition of <i>An Alphabet</i> which was then sold for 21 for twenty-six prints.  The deluxe edition of <i>London Types</i>, a set of twelve prints, was limited to forty sets.  \nThis print is not part of any known series although it bears close affinity to <i>London Types, </i>in particular <i>The Guardsman</i> and <i>The Beefeater.</i>  Using patriotic red, white and blue, Nicholson has enhanced the very Englishness of his choice of subject and lightened the heavy quality of the stark outlines.\"",
