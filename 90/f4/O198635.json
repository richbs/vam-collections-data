They may have once formed part of a box, since lost. Their style suggests that they are from Sri Lanka, or possible India, although heavily dependent on Dutch design, and possibly intended for the Portuguese market. The missing jewels or paste ornaments would have been in keeping with this. They may however be somewhat earlier than 1800. The fleshy flowers and foliate designs recall chintzes made in Southeast India of the early eighteenth century, forms ultimately derived from Dutch sources.\nIvory carving had a long tradition on the Indian subcontinent, and elaborate works of art were made, particularly as diplomatic gifts, often presented to Western rulers. Most of the ivory would have been exported from Mozambique in East Africa.",
