            "public_access_description": "This \"Aura\" martini glass is one item from a range of drinking vessels, vases and bowls designed by Jasper Conran, one of Britain's most successful fashion designers. Martini is a classic cocktail mix of gin and vermouth on ice, usually served with a twist of lemon or olive.\n\nCommissioned by Stuart Crystal of the Waterford Wedgwood Group in 1999, Aura is one of several contemporary designs intended for modern lifestyle trends and informal dining, the others being Ice, Strata and Zita. Jasper Conran took his inspiration from the four elements: earth, wind, fire and water. He approached glass in the same way as his clothing - for him \"the cut is everything\". He describes his glass designs as being \"clean and subtle...a pleasure to hold and behold\".  The glasses are in fact surprisingly heavy to hold, with bold deep cutting. The designs are simple but dramatic, festive and fun. Their dynamism has since inspired cheaper imitators - an indication of their success and novelty.\n\nJasper Conran is the son of designer, restaurateur and founder of Habitat, Sir Terence Conran and his second wife, writer Shirley Conran. One of his classic black evening dresses (T.527-1996) featured in the V&A's \"The Cutting Edge\" exhibition in 1997. Since 1990, he has also been in demand for stage costume and set design. His affordable \"J\" ranges for Debenham's now account for 10% of the store's turnover. He has recently designed furnishing fabric and wallpaper for the Designers' Guild and launched his own perfume brand. Since diversifying into glassware for Stuart Crystal in 1999, he has produced lighting designs for Stuart and further tabletop designs (bone china, glass, cutlery) for Stuart's parent company Waterford Wedgwood.\n\nStuart & Sons Ltd of the Redhouse Glassworks, Stourbridge, West Midlands, was formerly one of the best-known names in British glass-making. In its heyday, between 1930s and 1960s, Stuart produced many stylish modern designs by well-known contemporary designers. Latterly, it's output tended towards traditional designs in cut-glass tableware. Stuart joined the Waterford Wedgwood Group in 1995 and production has since transferred to the Waterford glassworks, Ireland.",
