            "public_access_description": "This small desk, known in French as a bonheur du jour, was a star piece in the collection of John Jones, who bequeathed his collection of French eighteenth-century decorative arts to the Museum in 1882.  It was attributed to the great royal cabinet-maker, Jean-Henri Riesener.  However, within a few years, curators were beginning to cast doubt on its date.  It is one of a group of desks of exactly the same form, all of which are now thought to have been made in Paris in about 1860.  At that time, French furniture from the reign of Louis XVI (1774-1792) was at the height of fashion, and many copies and versions of the 18th-century designs were made. Furniture with porcelain mounts was particularly valued by collectors.  The plaques on this piece loosely follow the design of porcelain plaques made by the S\u00e8vres porcelain factory during the 1770s and 1780s.",
