The interiors were ravaged by fire just eleven years later, and replaced to great effect by joncs's pupil John Webb 1648-150. Chambers was employed at Wilton by the roth Earl of Pembroke 1757-1759 for the design and completion of a Triumphal Arch, Casino, Rock Bridge and interior of library. The chimneypiece drawing may be behind a design in the Treatise. (See 8416.1, 3387 and 7076.25).",
