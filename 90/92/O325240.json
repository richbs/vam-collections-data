They may have been made in France, but it is more likely that they come from Piedmont, just across the border in Italy, where this type of net background was a speciality of Vercelli.\n\nThey would originally have had a hinged wire across the top of the crescent, but this has been bent down and soldered in place, and a new gold wire added in the centre, to make them more convenient to wear.",
