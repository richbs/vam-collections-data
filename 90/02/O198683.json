It is a copy in miniature of the famous Schroder House in Utrecht, The Netherlands which was designed by Gerrit Rietveld in 1924. Rietveld was an exponent of De Stijl, a Dutch art movement that focused on form and colour to achieve a pure abstraction. Colours were limited to black, white, and grey and the primary colours red, yellow, and blue. Rietveld also pioneered open-plan living, with his creative, flexible use of space, something which has become more common in the modern homes of today.\n\nThe dolls' house is painted predominately grey in keeping with the original building. It was designed to be played with and this is reflected in the quality of the build and how the front of the building can be opened allowing access to the rooms behind.",

It was clearly intended to be used as a plaything and not as an architectural model.\n\nHistorical significance: This house is a fine copy of the Schroder House which stands in Utrecht, The Netherlands and is considered an icon of the Modernist Movement in architecture. The Schroder House was designed by Gerrit Thomas Rietveld for Truus Schroder in 1924 and is based on the principles of De Stijl, using only primary colours in combination with white, grey, and black. Other artists associated with De Stijl include Piet Mondrian and Bart van der Leck.",
