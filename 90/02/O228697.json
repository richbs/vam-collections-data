Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of the seven gods of good fortune in their treasure-ship.\n\nThe gods Hotei, Daikoku and Ebisu all appear in this netsuke. However the size and bulky shape of this piece suggests that it was used as a decorative okimono rather than a netsuke. Netsuke had to be small and compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. This piece would have been impractical to wear.",
