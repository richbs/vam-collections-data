            "public_access_description": "This engraving by C. Le Meunni\u00e8 shows furniture legs designed by the French designer Richard de Lalonde, active in the late 18th century. These legs were possibly intended for a console table, a type of side table popularised around this period. They were small tables set against a wall, with ornate legs such as these. Imaginative variations on classical themes, such as these legs, were frequent in the earliest period of French neo-classicism. One leg is made up of bound reed, the other is a quiver of arrows with twisted fluting.",
