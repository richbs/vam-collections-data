They were usually attached with tiny screws.\n\nPeople\nThe firm of Cope and Timmins was formed by the amalgamation of two earlier firms, Cope and Collinson, and Clarke and Timmins, in 1900. Both firms were brass- founders, meaning that they specialised in brass products, and had factories in Birmingham, the renowned centre of brass manufacturing, as well as premises in London. Brass-founders produced a wide range of goods including castors, hinges, handles, lock plates, and curtain fittings as well as decorative furniture mounts.\n\nTime\nThe enormous popularity of historic revivals from 1800 - 1840 resulted in a corresponding demand for a range of designs for decorative brass mounts. Manufacturers borrowed freely from each other and many of the same patterns remained popular, being reproduced over many years, like this mount.",
