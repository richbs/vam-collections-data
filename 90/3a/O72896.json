Mrs Watt's bequest to the Museum also included a number of Japanese bronzes, together with items of lacquer work, enamel and porcelain. The Museum wanted this bust too, for as 'a nucleus is being formed of portraits, busts, etc. of benefactors to the Museum . . . a place could be found for exhibiting them together.'\n\nLawrence Macdonald (1799-1878) was a Scottish sculptorwho trained in Edinburgh, but spent most of his adult life living and working in Rome. He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy in London, and at the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh. He also showed works at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Prince Albert was one of his patrons, and he executed ideal sculpture for Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.",

Mrs Watt's bequest to the Museum included a number of Japanese bronzes, together with items of lacquer work, enamel and porcelain. Documentation relating to its acquisition records that the bust was 'characteristic of the period...we would also like to have the bust, as a nucleus is being formed of portraits, busts, &c of benefactors to the Museum. Somewhere, in the new building, a place could be found for exhibiting them together'.",
