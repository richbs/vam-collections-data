The green stem rises from the bottom of the painting with six long pointed, inwardly-curving leaves.  Three blooms and two buds rise on short stems from the main stalk. The blooms are detailed with hatchings in pink against a white ground, while the leaves are painted in a similar fashion with darker green hatched lines against two tones of a pale green ground.\n      The flower is set against a plain off-white mottled paper ground mounted on a similarly coloured page.  The painting is framed with strips of beige-coloured paper collaged onto the main border, the margins of which have strips of greeny-blue paper attached to them.  A further grey strip of paper has been added on the right hand side to act as a gutter for the present album binding. The edges of the page are gilded.",
