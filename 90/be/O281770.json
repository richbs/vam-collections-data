On one of these objects is a Ms label \"From modelling shop\", the label itself evidently many years old. The object I have identified as one half (cut diagonally) of a square inlaid 13th century tile from Chertsey Abbey; a similar half tile in the British Museum is illustrated in the Museum catalogue of English earthenware. In 1905 three panels of Chertsey tiles came to light in the store rooms west of the Exhibition Road amongst modern tile work which formerly belonged, I believe, to what was known as the \"Building Collection\", they then had registered numbers assigned to them and are now exhibited in Room 137. These panels were fixed on slate beds, so is the half tile I have now found, and I think it may fairly be assumed that it was acquired through the same channel (perhaps the Office of Works?).\"\nDirector's remarks: I agree, doubtless the entry you suggest will constitute a sufficient caveat in case some indignant owner turned up to claim them.",
