It first appeared about 350, possibly for use in private prayer. Until about 1000 the custom was to suspend a cross above the altar, or to place it alongside, but later the cross was generally put directly on the altar. Crosses were also carried in procession before a service, and on ceremonial occasions such as funerals. In early times, people held them in their hand, but later they raised them high on poles. \n\nBoth altar and processional crosses were generally made of precious or gilded metal, or ivory, and decorated with gems or enamel. From about 800 they bore the image of the crucified Christ and became known as crucifixes. By about 1100 the imagery of European crosses had become established. It usually included the symbols of the four Evangelists (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John), often with the Virgin Mary and St John flanking the cross.\n\nIn this example, the enamels on the front show the symbols, the lion, ox, eagle and winged man, of the Evangelists, surrounding the missing figure of the crucified Christ. On the back is the Resurrection, with other scenes from the life of Christ and the archangel St Michael at the top.

            "public_access_description": "The cross is the central emblem of Christianity and the symbol of Christ\u2019s Crucifixion. It first appeared about 350, possibly for use in private prayer. Until about 1000 the custom was to suspend a cross above the altar, or to place it alongside, but later the cross was generally put directly on the altar. Crosses were also carried in procession before a service, and on ceremonial occasions such as funerals. In early times, people held them in their hand, but later they raised them high on poles. \n\nBoth altar and processional crosses were generally made of precious or gilded metal, or ivory, and decorated with gems or enamel. From about 800 they bore the image of the crucified Christ and became known as crucifixes. By about 1100 the imagery of European crosses had become established. It usually included the symbols of the four Evangelists (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John), often with the Virgin Mary and St John flanking the figure of Christ crucified.\n\nIn this example, the enamels on the front show the symbols, the lion, ox, eagle and winged man, of the Evangelists, surrounding the missing figure of the crucified Christ. On the back is the Resurrection, with other scenes from the life of Christ and the archangel St Michael at the top. The armour worn by the soldiers helps to indicate the date of the cross.",

            "history_note": "This was probably a processional cross, but as the original knop is missing this cannot be confirmed absolutely (see Dalmases: 1992, I, p.91). The form of the cross, with its arms terminating in a fleur-de-lis shape, indicates a late-fourteenth or early-fifteenth-century date. The circular scrolls of foliage embossed on the silver plaques at the ends of the arms of the cross suggest this dating can be narrowed to around 1400 (compare with another V&amp;A cross, M.307-1956: see Dalmases: 1992, I, no. 24). The cross has silver plaques, engraved and enamelled, on both sides at the end of each arm and in the centre. The choice of iconography is, in some ways, unusual. Many surviving crucifixes of this period from Catalonia incorporate scenes related to Christ's Passion (Mart\u00ednez Subias: 1988, pp. 62-65). This example, on the other hand, emphasises the elements of redemption and rebirth in Christ's sacrifice, and has plaques on the reverse that depict the Annunciation, Christ's birth and His Resurrection. The plaque depicting St Michael Archangel may be a reference to the patron saint of a particular church but if so, it is impossible to establish which one without further evidence as there are a number of churches in Tarragona devoted to St Michael. The front of the cross would have had a cast figure of the crucified Christ applied over the central plaque depicting His nimbus. As on other crosses of the period, the symbols of the four Evangelists are on the surrounding plaques. The original positions of the plaques on both sides of the cross have been changed. On the reverse, Christ in Majesty should be switched with St Michael Archangel, and the Adoration of the Magi should be where the Annunciation is now positioned; on the front, the symbol of St John should be on the upper arm and that of St Matthew on the lower one.\nA number of medieval crosses from Tarragona survive (Mart\u00ednez Subias: 1988, pp. 62-3). This example has been described as typical of workshop production from the area and has been linked to three other crosses with similar town marks for the Tarragona assay office (Guidol i Cunill: 1915-20, pp. 338-9; Dalmases: 1992, I, p. 100). None of these other crosses shares the redemptive iconography of the V&amp;A one although similar plaques depicting Christ's nimbus are found on two other crosses. One of these, from Falset, is part of the group marked for Tarragona (Dalmases: 1992, p. 100; Guidol i Cunill: 1915-20, fig. 63). The other is on a cross of around 1400 marked for Montblanc (in the province of Tarragona: see Mart\u00ednez Subias: 1988, no. 31.7 and fig. 125).\nThe collector and Museum benefactor W. L. Hildburgh acquired the cross in Paris in 1930; it entered the Museum collections as part of his bequest in 1956.",
