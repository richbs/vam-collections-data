            "public_access_description": "This chimneypiece, designed by Augustus W.N. Pugin (1812-1852) is from The Bishop's House, Bath Street, Birmingham, which had to be demolished because of a road-widening scheme. It was built by George Myers (1804-1875) during 1840-1 and was located opposite the Cathedral.\nFollowing its demolition the object was given by His Grace the Archbishop of Birmingham to the Museum in 1961. Initially acquired by the Circulation Department, it was later transferred to the Sculpture Department in 1981, following the closure of the Circulation Department. Two chairs also designed by Pugin were also given to the Museum, now in the Furniture Department.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin was an architect, designer and writer whose work became the theoretical and practical inspiration for the Gothic Revival movement. A precocious youth, he designed furniture for Windsor Castle while in his teens.  In 1851 his Medieval Court was one of the sensations of the Great Exhibition in London. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835,  Pugin increasingly identified the Gothic style with Christianity, so that the two became inextricably linked and the style took on a positive moral dimension. Yet his greatest work is a secular building: the Palace of Westminster, designed by Charles Barry, for which Pugin provided the decoration and detail.",
