The scalloped edge is also found on more elaborate examples with circular compartments, often embellished with inlay in brass and mother of pearl, associated with the German immigrant maker Frederick Hintz who worked in London in the 1730s.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe plain baluster (the pillar), legs and feet and also the lack of detailed carving suggest that this table was used by a merchant or professional rather than a member of the aristocracy.\n\nMaterials & Making\nMahogany began to be imported into Britain in significant amounts during the early 1720s. The source was the West Indies, in particular Jamaica.  By 1721 the customs duty on Jamaican mahogany had been lifted. The best quality timbers were obtained from ports which had a direct trade with the West Indies, such as Bristol and Liverpool.  Cabinet-makers welcomed the wood because of its strength and because it carved well. It was beautifully grained and coloured. Mahogany planks could be sawn wide enough to enable a large circular top for a table to be cut out in one piece.",
