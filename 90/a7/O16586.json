April shows lovers making music by a canal while in the fields beyond a cow is milked, the sheep are taken out to graze and on a chimney pot a stork makes it\u00eds nest. May shows a scene of May Day merrymaking; a boat trip with musicians, a floral procession and dancing in the square.\n\nSimon Bening was one of the most celebrated illuminators of his time. He worked mainly in Bruges. His work often comes close to contemporary panel painting, particularly in full-page miniatures, such as these, where the image is surrounded by a simple border similar to a picture frame.\n\nIn the late medieval period Books of Hours were a type of prayerbook for private use by the laity, containing psalms and devotions for the eight canonical hours of the day. They were typically small and portable. Simon Bening\u2019s workshop made many Books of Hours, often containing calendar illustrations.",

            "bibliography": "<i>100 Great Paintings in The Victoria & Albert Museum.</i>London: V&A, 1985, p.36\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Simon Benninck 1483- 1561 \n<i>Netherlandish School</i> \nTHE MONTH OF MAY, LEAF FROM A CALENDAR OF A BOOK OF HOURS \nBodycolour on vellum, 14 X 9.5 cm \nE.4575-1910. <i>Salting Bequest</i>.\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, Calendars, listing saints' days, month by month, formed an integral part of books for services and for private devotion, such as Psalters and Books of Hours. They were illustrated with the occupations of the months and hence it was in the pages of these religious manuscripts that most medieval pictures of secular activities are to be found. And when, from the late 14th century, there was a renewed interest in direct observation from nature, it was in Calendar illustrations that the early experiments in naturalism were made. \n\nThis is a late, exceptionally charming example of the type, dating from about 1540 when the printed book was rapidly replacing the manuscript. It illustrates the month of May with a scene of May Day merrymaking: a boat trip with musicians, a floral procession and dancing in the square. The town appears to be a fantasy, loosely based on Bruges, but all the details of architecture, landscape and figures, down to the unconcerned washerwoman, emphasize the naturalism pioneered by the Flemish School in the 15th century. On the reverse of this sheet is the miniature for April (Courting), another sheet in the Museum has August (Reaping), and September (Sowing, Harrowing) and there are two further leaves from this series in the British Library (MS Add 18855). In these, as in all such Calendar illustrations, there is a striking contrast between the leisure activities, enjoyed principally by the aristocracy, and the work in the fields done by peasants.\n \nSimon Benninck was one of the last major representatives of the early Flemish School. Born in Ghent, he moved to Bruges in 1508 and remained there for most of his life. He worked together with his father, Alexander, on the Grimani Breviary and other important illuminated manuscripts. His self-portrait, painted in body colour on vellum, also in the Museum, epitomizes the close link between the Ghent-Bruges School of Illuminators and the origins of the portrait miniature in Tudor England. Indeed, Simon's daughter Levina Teerlinc (d.1576) was one of the Flemish artists who received official payments for portrait miniatures in the reign of Henry VIII.\n\nMichael Kauffmann\"",
