It shows a bull clock on a table-shaped stand. The bull resembles the one on the Buffalo clock made about 1770 in Cox's workshop although the rock-shaped base is different. The clock is the collection of the Palace Museum, Beijing.  This drawing has been tentatively attributed to Charles Magniac, a craftsman trained as a chaser.\n\nThe purpose of the drawing is likely to be a presentation drawing for the client. It combines characteristics of designs for objects intended for production, with features also found in craftsmen's and retailers' record drawings.\n\nFortunately, this drawing proved to be most useful in locating the table-shaped stand, and supporting sea-horses and sea-bulls for the Buffalo clock at the Palace Museum. Clock and stand were reunited and displayed together in the exhibition 'Treasures from the Forbidden City' at the Museum Speelklok in Utrecht in 2010.",

The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 138, no. 1119 (June 1996), pp. 402-404.\n<u>Schatten uit de Verboden Stad[Treasures from the forbidden city]</u> Utrecht: Museum Speelklok, 2010. ISBN: 978-90-801699-7-5.\nExhibition catalogue\nThe drawing depicts a bull clock on a table shaped stand. The bull resembles the one on the Buffalo Clock [cat. 7], but the rock shaped base is different. This indicates that James cox used different variations of the same theme in his designs. It is unlikely that the drawing is a design, but the reason for the drawing is unknown, as well as the designer. The drawing proved very useful as it was used to locate the support frame at the Palace Museum, which is now displayed with the Buffalo clock. In addition the clock decorations like sea-horses amd sea-bulls were also found in the Palace Museum.\nFor the purpose of the exhibition, the Buffalo clock, stand and decorations have been assembled to give an idea of what a singsong would have looked like in Beijing in the eigthteenth century.",
