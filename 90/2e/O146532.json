Entitled Pharaoh Falls III - The Exorcist is called in, it was the first of four equally far-fetched illustrations depicting the last journey of a pharaoh from his palace to his tomb. The necromancer has been summoned to drive away the evil spirit possessing the body of the sick ruler, but the charms he holds out and the incantations he utters are to no avail, and the pharaoh dies. \n\nMatania was an Italian illustrator and historical painter, described in the introduction to this Egyptian section in the magazine as having 'a very special genius for reconstructing the past'. He was The Sphere's Special Artist, and also worked for other periodicals in Milan, Paris and London.",
