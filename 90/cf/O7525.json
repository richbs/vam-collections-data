It has a hinged bulbous stopper. \nThe bottle is made from nephrite jade, dark green, with decoration carved in relief, gold mounts and a gold stopper.\n The decoration depicts a grasshopper on a lotus leaf and on  the reverse a grasshopper on perhaps millet. The metal mounts are moulded in the form of millet or corn and the foot is formed by metal mount.  \nEngraved with 'G. R. Sandoz' and inscribed '2506' there is also an eagle's head warranty mark. \nThis old jade snuff bottle was embellished with gold mounts in Paris at the workshop of G. R. Sandoz some time after Gustave Roger Sandoz succeeded his father Gustave in the family business in 1891, probably for use as a scent bottle.",
