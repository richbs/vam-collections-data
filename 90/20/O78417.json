Popular joy at the return of the Stuarts in 1660 found expression in many lockets and other kinds of jewellery that showed support for Charles II, or commemorated his father, Charles I, who had been executed in 1649.\n\nHistorical Associations\nPortugal is often described as Britain's oldest ally. Negotiations for a marriage between Catherine of Braganza (1638-1705) and Charles II began in the 1640s during his father's reign, and were resumed after the Restoration in 1660. Portugal needed a counterweight to the might of the Spanish empire, and the dowry offered to Britain with Catherine included Bombay, Tangier, trading privileges in Brazil and two million Portugese crowns, in return for naval and military support. Catherine's freedom to exercise her faith as a Catholic in Britain was guaranteed. She and Charles were married according to both Catholic and Protestant rites on 21 May 1662.\n\nPeople\nCatherine of Braganza was the daughter of John IV of Portugal. She was described in 1663 by the diarist Samuel Pepys as 'mighty pretty', but she was not well educated and appears not to have been influential in politics. Charles continued his relations with his mistresses. None of Catherine's babies was born alive, and she was at times the object of severe anti-Catholic animosity. However, when divorce was proposed in 1679, Charles stood by her.  After his death she moved to Somerset House, and established a convent in Hammersmith. Following the accession of William and Mary she returned to Portugal, where she supported a further treaty with England, and became regent in 1704.",
