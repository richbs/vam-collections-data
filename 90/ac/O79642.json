The end of each half is decorated with applied designs of twisted wire rings arranged in triangles.  There is a rosette of rings of twisted wire in the centre of each half with a coloured paste in its centre, one turquoise and one red.  The rim of each half is bordered with a thick band of wire twisted into a cable.  The pin which fastens the bracelet is made of doubled wire which is secured by a bar inside the hinge so that it cannot fall out and be lost.  There is a pendent disc attached to its top.",

In the Syrian region, which incorporated much of Palestine, Jordan and Lebanon as well as Syria itself in the 19th century, they were worn by all sections of society, from townswomen to the nomadic Bedouin of the desert.  The designs vary by sector and show influences from a wide area, reflecting Syria\u2019s strong trading traditions and central location.\n\nHinged bracelets, like this one, were more common among the settled urban and rural population.  The use of a red and green piece of glass and applied rings of twisted wire are both characteristic of Syrian traditional jewellery.  It was bought for two shillings and sixpence (the pair) at the International Exhibition, London, in 1872.  Its name was recorded as \u2018ussuar\u2019, which is a generic Arabic name for bracelets in the region.",
