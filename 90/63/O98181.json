Its elaborate decoration gives an indication of the importance of hunting to the 16th century nobility.\n\nBoar hunting remained a popular pastime in much of Europe for centuries. The last part of the hunt usually involved approaching the cornered boar on foot through dense undergrowth. Boar-hunting was regarded as an extreme test of courage and skill. More functional boar spears had cross-bars behind the blade which kept the hunter beyond the reach of sharp tusks by preventing the spear penetrating too deeply. \n\nDecorative spears like this were deemed worthy of a place in a rustkammer (armoury) alongside ceremonial halberds and pikes.",

More functional boar spears had cross-bars behind the blade which kept the hunter beyond the reach of sharp tusks by preventing the spear penetrating too deeply. Decorative spears like this were deemed worthy of a place in a rustkammer (armoury) alongside ceremonial halberds and pikes.",
