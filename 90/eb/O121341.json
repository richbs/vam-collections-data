            "public_access_description": "This is a pencil drawing of a woman in an evening dress with a red fabric sample stapled to the page at the bottom right, designed by Marjorie Field in the1940s for the haute couture firm Field Rhoades which was registered in the London street directories at 77, South Audley Street, London, W1 for the years 1948 to 1949. The words 'cire moire' , written in pencil at the top left, describe the material that the designer envisaged being used. 'Cire' is a term used to describe a highly glazed finish, usually achieved by applying wax, heat and pressure to a a fabric. 'Moire' means waterered silk, or another fabric with a wavy 'watered' surface pattern. It also refers to the technique in which a heated roller is applied to fabric, creating the watered effect.  \n\nThis drawing relates closely to E.483:10-2005, a presentation design in pencil and bodycolour included in a Field Rhoades volume with printed descriptions and prices, which shows a red evening dress in a matt rayon crepe French jersey. The pose of the woman and the general form of the dress is almost identical in the two designs, so it is probably that the pencil drawing represents an earlier stage in the design process for the same dress, and even that E.483:10-2005 was traced from it. The contrasting piping along the neck and waistlines seen in the pencil drawing is no longer present.",
