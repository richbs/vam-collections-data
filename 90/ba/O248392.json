The trough has a narrow ridge down the cnetre and its edges are grooved to hold the metal grater (missing). On the other side is carved a symmetrical design of scrolling foliage and flowers, amid which, between two serpents, stands a Cupid holdinga dove in his raised left hand; above is a basket of flowers and fruit. On the cover is carved a peacock in his pride between an open and closed flower; above is a human face with rays representing the sun.",

On the cover a peacock stands between an open and closed flower.\nA snuff rasp was used like a nutmeg grater for grating dried tobacco into snuff.  A perforated metal section was fixed inside the ivory cover for grating. Snuff taking was a popular pastime in France for the wealthy and fashionable. There was the rumour that a regular dose of snuff would protect against the plague. The tobacco was grated from the solid tobacco roll known as a \"carotte\".\nThe ivory carving on these rasps is often rather crude, while the subjects depicted, often mythological figures, or exotic ladies, are typical of decorative objects made from a rare and costly material to be sold as luxury good.",
