The design, which contains a central ogival shape formed by four touching acanthus leaves, shows a symetrical but haphazard pattern of curving leaves and flowers including carnations, peonies, tulips, briony and others. The ground is blue with flowers and leaves in pastel colours incliding peach, pink, mauve, greens, blues, grey, silver, brown and beige. The panel has two narrow (approximately 2'' or 5cm wide) borders to the left and right hand side and a wide (11.5'' or 29cm) border at the hem. An outside border, which continues round three sides of the embroidery shows a wavy line of pale and mid-green on pale and light blue. The lower border shows a central artichoke motif with trailing tulips and acanthus leaves with edge stripes and castellated decoration in peach, pale blue, brown and white. \n\nThe panel has a ground worked in vertical flame stitch with flowers and leaves in long, short and satin stitches. Stem outlining and one type of leaf is worked in laid and couch work with raised flowerheads effected with Frendch knots. The outer border is embroidered with long, short and stem stitches. \n\nThe embroidery is lined with Morris and Company shot silks of brown with a panel of violet coloured silk down the centre. There are no signs of use and the panel was probably never hung.\n\nThe panel as originally designed in 1880 for Lady Bell of Rounton Grange.",
