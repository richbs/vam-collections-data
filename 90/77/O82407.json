Although made of glass, with its brilliant silvering and traditional pattern of engraved vine leaves and grapes it is nearest to the bright copper- or silver- lustred ceramic wares typical of north-eastern English potteries.  Despite its apparently practical shape, it would have been bought as a curiosity, possibly to impress its owner's visitors.\n\n  Materials & Making\nThe process of making double-walled silvered glass was patented by Edward Varnish and Frederick Hale Thompson in 1849.  A number of glassworks, such as that of James Powell & Sons of Whitefriars, London, made the blanks.  A stemmed vase or goblet shape was formed, with  the glass-blower stopping short of opening out the mouth.  Instead, the top of the vase, still sealed as a bubble-shape, was reheated and 'dropped' inwards to form a double-walled interior. This plain, undecorated vase was then supplied to E. Varnish & Co., where it was filled between the walls from the foot end with a solution of silver nitrate and glucose (in the form of grape juice).  The final stage was to seal the hole in the foot with a metal disc, in this example marked for Varnish's Patent. \n\nTime\nThe silvered glass exhibited by E. Varnish & Co. fascinated commentators on the 1851 Great Exhibition. Varnish's salvers, vases, globes and goblets were bold in size and presentation, using non-tarnishing silver, ornamented with coloured casing, cutting and engraving. The process 'added a richness and beauty of colouring to that material of which few could deem it capable of receiving' (Illustrated London News).",
