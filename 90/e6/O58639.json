            "public_access_description": "The term 'oboe' derives from hautbois, the French for 'loud\u2019 or \u2018high wood[wind]'. Oboes are high-pitched, three-jointed reed instruments which developed from the shawm, a medieval version with an opening like a trumpet and a more raucous tone. This development of the oboe took place in the mid 17th century at the French court, among a group of instrumentalists and instrument makers in the Grand Ecurie, the royal musical ensemble used to accompany open-air ceremonies and festivities. Its invention is often ascribed specifically to Jean Hotteterre (d.  1690), one of the Grande Ecurie musicians during the reign of Louis XIV. The oboe rapidly proved versatile as a solo, chamber and orchestral instrument, its use spreading rapidly from France to Germany, Italy and England.\n\nThe bell of this oboe is decorated with two carved scenes representing contemporary men and women in fashionable dress. One shows a man and woman dancing to the accompaniment of a violin. The other depicts a woodwind ensemble of two oboes, a tenor oboe and a bassoon, playing from part-books laid flat on a table. Until the appearance of music stands in the 1700s, this was the normal way of playing from sheet-music.",
