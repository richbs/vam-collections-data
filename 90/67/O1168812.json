Malvern Link Common . 21.9.1970 - 22.9.1970. Performance category: circus. The programme took place twice daily. The adult 'popular prices' were 3/6, 5/-, 7/6 and 10/6, bookable. The note mentions that September 21st was a Monday. Since the prices are quoted in new pence yet the programme has many of the acts on S.3761-1995 which has prices in new pence, this is probably a 1970 poster.",
