He is portrayed with white hair and a flowing beard and his attribute is the knife with which he intended to sacrifice Isaac. \nTo test Abraham's faith God commanded him to make a burnt offering of his son, Isaac. They went to the place of sacrifice Abraham on an ass and Isaac carrying wood for the altar fire. Abraham bound Isaac, laid him on the altar and drew his knife, at which point an angel appeared and stayed Abraham's hand. God recognises Abraham as a God-fearing man as he had not withheld his son. On looking up, Abraham saw a ram caught in a thorny thicket, which he then sacrificed instead.\nThis subject occupies a central place in medieval typology - in which it was considered to prefigure the Crucifixion and God's sacrifice of Christ. Isaac carries the wood as Christ carried the cross, the ram came to represent Christ, the thicket the crown of thorns.\nAccording to Muslim tradition, Abraham's sacrifice took place on the site of the Mosque of Omar  (The Dome of the Rock) Jerusalem.",
