He is naked other than wearing a garland, and large ear, neck and wrist ornaments. He is carrying a club in his left hand and skull cap held at chest level in his right. He stands beside the bull Nandi, the head of which bears some damage, presumably forming part of a group depicting the family group of Shiva and Uma, known as <i>Umamaheshvara</i>.  The damaged carving above the head of Nandi may have represented part of the hand or foot of one of the two principal deities resting on a lotus cushion. The attributes borne by the figure are normal for a Kapalika ascetic.",
