            "history_note": "This dress was worn by Miss Emilie Grigsby (1876-1964) who was a wealthy independent American who came to England from New York. She established a salon which was frequented by writers and the military. She was considered to be one of the great international beauties, with extremely pale, almost transparent skin and golden hair. She was frequently the subject of articles in the New York Times during the early 20th century. Her clothes were purchased from couturiers in London, Paris, and New York, and demonstrated an elegantly avant-garde approach to style.\n\nEmilie Grigsby's friend, Miss Chisholm stated at time of acquisition that this ensemble was worn for a wedding; but it is not clear which wedding. As Emilie Grigsby never married, this must have been worn by her as a wedding-guest.",
