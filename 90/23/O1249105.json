The figures were bought in 1937 were made by the master puppet maker Arthur Quisto (1882-1960), except the two boxers and the ghost, whose maker is not known.\n\nMr Punch was first recorded in England in 1662 by the famous diarist Samuel Pepys when he saw him as a marionette, operated in Covent Garden by the Italian puppet showman Signor Bologna. Pulchinella, as he was then called, was presented within a tent rather than in the type of booth we know today. Pepys brought his wife to see the show two weeks later and that October the same show was performed at Whitehall for the King. \n\nThe booth comprises several parts that were put together for a show. The dismantled aluminium frame was carried in a canvas carrying bag while the stage, curtains, fascia board top and struts, properties and puppets fitted into a suitcase.",
