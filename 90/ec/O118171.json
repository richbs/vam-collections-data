Believed to date from the 11th century, it is made up of eight conjoined sections of different lengths and displays over 70 scenes, with decorative borders running along the top and bottom. The tapestry has been on permanent display in Bayeux, Normandy, since 1842. \n\nIn 1873 the publishers Cundall & Co. made photographs of the tapestry for the Department of Science and Art, a British government body. The prints are the same size as the tapestry and are hand-coloured. One copy went to the South Kensington Museum (later the V&A) and this, in turn, was the model for a replica of the tapestry made in 1885 by a team of English women embroiderers under the direction of Elizabeth Wardle, now on display in the Museum of Reading.",

            "history_note": "In 1873 Joseph Cundall made photographs of the Bayeux Tapestry using the autotype (Woodburytyoe) process, for the Department of Science and Art to be issued through the Arundel Society. The prints are actual size and hand coloured. The tapestry is 214 feet long, by about 20 inches high and the photograph corresponds. It required 180  glass plates (20x15 inches).\n\nThe V&A has two copies. This one, 201-1874, is fixed to a continuous roll backed onto linen. It was at one time displayed in room 108 on a rolling mechanism which broke and was deemed too expensive to replace. The other copy, E.573:1 to 25-2005, exists in 25 separate rolls.",
