Chains worn around the neck or shoulders were a common form of courtly jewellery in the 15th and 16th centuries.  A similar 15th-century collar composed of 41 cast letters 'S' was found on the banks of the Thames in London in 1983 and is now in the Museum of London.\n\nOwnership & Use\nLivery collars composed of S-shaped links became popular at the English court after their introduction by John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster (1340-1399). They ranged from the jewelled gold collars sported by royalty and the nobility to the ribbon or leather collars with silver or copper letters attached that were worn by lesser officials. Pendants could be hung from the chain as symbols of office or to indicate allegiance to a particular group.\n\nAuthenticity\nIt has been suggested that this chain is of Nordic rather than English origin. It was purchased from Iceland with a 19th-century pendant attached and it is possible that the chain is also 19th century. In 1986 a similar chain was analysed by the Assay Office of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths. Impurities in the metal corresponded to those found in mid-19th-century silver. This has cast some doubt on the authenticity of the present example.",
