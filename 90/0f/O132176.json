He then returned to Bassano to work in his father's workshop until his death in 1539. He later travelled often to Venice and maintained close friendship with the great masters of this time such as Jacopo Tintoretto (1519-1594), Annibale Carracci (1560-1609) and Paolo Veronese (1528-1588).  Among his pupils were his sons Leandro, Francesco, Giambattista and Gerolamo.\n\nThis painting is a reduced copy after a well-known composition by Jacopo Bassano, The Good Samaritan (The National Gallery, London). It illustrates a parable from the New Testament  relating how a traveller's wounded on the road was rescued by a Samaritan while a priest and a Levite passed by. This painting is a good example of Jacopo's mature period marked by a darker palette and subtle contrast between light and shade.",

            "history_note": "Purchased, 1866\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a reduced copy, probably of late 18th or early 19th century date, of <i>The Good Samaritan</i> by Jacopo Bassano, now in the National Gallery, London (no. 227; see N. G. Catalogues, G. Gould, <i>16th century Venetian School</i>, 1959, p. 12; <i>Illustrations, Italian Schools</i>, 1937, p. 23). The original measures 40 x 31\u00bc (101 x 79). A preparatory drawing for that composition is in the Courtauld Institute, London. The original painting was in the collection of Sir Joshua Reynolds (d. 1792), was inherited by his niece the Dowager Marchioness of Thomond, and purchased in 1821 by Samuel Rogers, at whose sale in 1856 it was acquired by the National Gallery. Numerous versions and derivatives of this work exist.\n\nThe present work shows a man, dressed in a red tunic and blue trousers, helping a half naked man to get on the horse in front of him. The composition is divided by rocks on the right, and a distant town is visible in the left background. The present work was originally brighter in tone, and has darkened owing to a degraded varnish.\n\nThe original work dates from Jacopo's mature period of around 1562-63, when he was searching for inventive compositions to renew traditional religious iconography. It illustrates a parable from the New Testament (Luke 10:25-38) which relates how a traveller, wounded by thieves on the road, was saved by a Samaritan, while a priest and Levite pass him by. The silver flask at the Samaritan's feet is probably for the oil, which he was to pour on the wounds, while dogs traditionally allude to fidelity and devotion. The distant town imay be the artist's native city of Bassano.",
