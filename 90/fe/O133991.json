In 1807 he entered the RA schools, and exhibited his first painting there. Made his name with 'The Disposal of a Favourite Lamb' in 1813; elected ARA 1814, RA 1820. Achieved great popularity with his landscapes and, particularly, rustic genre scenes in the 1820s; Ruskin highly praised his works in the 1840s. Married in 1822 the sister of the portrait painter Margaret Carpenter. Travelled extensively in Britain and abroad, especially in Italy 1836-38; these visits are reflected in the subjects he painted. Exhibited 124 works at the RA between 1807 and 1846, and 45 at the BI 1808-43. Librarian at the RA 1840-2. Died London 17 February 1847. His studio sale was at Christie's 31 May-5 June 1847. His two sons were the novelist William Wilkie Collins and the painter Charles Allston Collins. There are watercolours and a sketchbook in the V&A collections. \n\nLIT: \tWilliam Collins 'List of Pictures and Patrons', two MS volumes 1808-27 and 1827-46, National Art Library, V&A (referred to below as Lists); <i>Athenaeum</i> 20 February 1847, p200 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i> 1847, p137 (obit); W Wilkie Collins <i>Memoirs of the Life of William Collins, Esq</i>, RA 2 vols, 1848 (referred to below as <i>Memoirs</i>); <i>Art Journal</i> 1855, p 141 W.

According to the Lists, painted for Sheepshanks in June 1841 for \u00a352 l0s: 'small picture, A Scene at Sorrento'. Collins had already listed a 'Sorrento Bay of Naples' as sold to a Mr Gibbons for \u00a3200 on 15 May 1840. Wilkie Collins (<i>Memoirs</i>, p205) describes the Sheepshanks painting as\n \nA repetition of the study from the upper end of the plain of Sorrento, mentioned in the account of the painter's residence there, as containing in the foreground a strip of cornfield overhung by a large chestnut-tree; and in the distance, olive gardens, the Mediterranean, and Vesuvius beyond. This picture and its companion, 'The Villa D'Esre, Tivoli' [see FA24, p34J were both executed with great vigour and brilliancy; and were painted for Mr Sheepshanks. \n\nEarlier (<i>Memoirs</i>, pp108), Wilkie Coli ins describes the original study as one of two large sketches, made in Sorrento, the first 'coloured with surpassing brilliancy and vigour ... as a piece of landscape-painting, it yields to nothing of its class that he ever produced' (the second sketch relates to 'The Caves of Ulysses at Sorrento, Naples', see FA25, p34). The original study may have been in the artist's posthumous sale at Christie's 31 May-5 June 1847, but is not identifiable from the several Sorrento subjects in the catalogue. It was presumably the Sheepshanks painting that was exhibited at the RA in 1842 (240), and described by the critic in the <i>Art Union</i> 1842 (pl23) as 'a small upright landscape painted with infinite sweetness. We have in it a mere sketch of the Bay, but (<i>che vorreste?</i>) with such a foreground we do not miss it'. \n\nLIT:<i>Lists</i>; <i>Memoirs</i> II, pp108, 205\"",
