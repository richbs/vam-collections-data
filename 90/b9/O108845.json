This was originally a Hawa Mahal (Palace of the winds) and it is probable that the king\u2019s concubines lived here. There was a secret passage which linked the private rooms to the western wall of the mosque nearby. An Asokan pillar (Lat) was brought by Firuz Shah from Topra in Ambala district and installed at the top of this structure.\n\nAs can be seen in the photograph, adjacent to this palace was a mosque for which the pillar acted as a symbolic minaret for and was called Minar-I Zarin (Golden minaret). \n\nSignature and negative number in bottom left hand side.",

The polished sandstone pillar is 13.1 m high. It is dated to the 3rd century BC and was brought by Firuz Shah from Topra in Ambala district.\n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites. He set up a studio in Simla with Charles Shepherd and sold his prints sold to an eager public both in India and Britain.",

Built in 1354 by Firus Shah, it is the 5th of the 7 historical cities of Delhi. The city, originally covered an area of 800 x 400 meters and encompassed palaces, mosques, pillared halls, a pigeon tower and a baoli, little of which survives today.\n\nThe pyramidal structure in this photograph is built from rubble has three storeys which have arched entrances. This was originally a Hawa Mahal (Palace of the winds) and it is probable that the king\u2019s concubines lived here. There was a secret passage which linked the private rooms to the western wall of the mosque nearby.\n\nAn Asokan pillar (Lat) was brought by Firuz Shah from Topra in Ambala district and installed at the top of this structure, and because of this the structure was often called the Lat Pyramid. The pillar is made of polished sandstone, dated to 3rd century BC and is 13.1m high.\n\nAs can be seen in the photograph, adjacent to this palace was a mosque for which the pillar acted as a symbolic minaret for and was called Minar-I Zarin (Golden minaret).",
