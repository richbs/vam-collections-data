This process takes place with each separate colour, which is slowly dried before another is applied. The consequence is that in the finished paper there is a considerable mass of solid colour. / \nMACHINE-PRINTED PAPERS are produced at a great speed, all the colours being printed at one time and rapidly dried in a heated gallery. In consequence of the speed at which they are printed, there is merely a film of colour deposited on the surface of the paper. / \nFOR PERMANENT USE we strongly recommend the hand-printed paper. / \n\nThe machine-printed papers are placed at the end of one of the books or in a msall book by themselves. / \n\nShow Rooms: / \n449, Oxford Street, London, W.'",

The layout is complete but additional detailing would have been necessary for etching or block cutting. As in the other early patterns, there is some depth in the drawing but no integration between the motifs and the ground. \n\nFlower trellises also appear elsewhere in the work of Morris and his associates, for example in 1862 stained glass for St Helen\u2019s, Darley Dale (cat. No. H.6) and All Saints, Selsley, and in Burne-Jones\u2019s 1863 sketch design for an embroidery for Ruskin illustrating Chaucer\u2019s <i>Legend of Goode Wimmen</i>. Mackail (p.143) described the \u2018wattled rose-trellises inclosing richly-flowered square garden plots\u2019 at Red House. This is a typical medieval garden plan, illustrated in numerous manuscripts. \n\nThe delay between design and registration was a result of the firm\u2019s attempt to print using oil colours and etched zinc plates. After the failure of this previously untried method, production was handed over to Jeffrey & Co., a reputable wallpaper manufacturer, who used the standard woodblock process and distemper colours. \n\nMorris remained fond of the early, simple patterns and hung a blue-ground version of <i>Trellis</i> in his bedroom at Kelmscott-House.' \n\n\u2018Mackail\u2019 refers to: Mackail, J. W. <u>The Life of William Morris</u>. London, 1899\n\n\u2018cat.
