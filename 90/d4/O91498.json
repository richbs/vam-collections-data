The bowl was shown to members of the London Society of Antiquaries in June 1910 by the President, Charles H. Read, who reported that Mulhall had explained it was from 'the house of an old family in the South of Ireland about half a century ago'. Read stressed that very little was known about the object, suggested that the large, embossed plaque in the well of the bowl 'rather recalls the silver-work of European Turkey', and speculated that it was not originally part of the piece. Mulhall's widow sold the bowl to the Museum in late 1930 or 1931, for the sum of \u00a3105. In the introduction to his 1962 picture book on Italian secular silver in the Museum, Charles Oman asserted that the bowl was 'of a quality suggesting that it comes from Venice itself'.",
