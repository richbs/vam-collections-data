These are skilfully combined with a vignette of a lady probably far wealthier than H. Samuel's own customers would have been, completing her evening adornment of jewellery. The influence of Art Nouveau is apparent not only in the style of the poster, but also in the design of many or the wares portrayed, although other goods, such as the tea set, are in the neo-Georgian style.\n\nThe company H. Samuel began as a clock-making business in Liverpool in 1821, and later expanded into the jewellery market, with retail branches originally throughout the North of England, and later the whole country.\n\n[Margaret Timmers, 'British Design at Home', p.102]",
