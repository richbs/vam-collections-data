The size of the pieces and the subject of the decorative motifs do not seem very appropriate for children, but the set was intended as a future heirloom rather than for a very young child's use.\n\nPeople\nGeorge William Adams (1808-1895), who made this set, worked for the silversmiths Chawner & Co. This firm was established in 1815 in Smithfield, London. Adams and his father-in-law William Chawner made other pieces of silver in this pattern, some of which they showed at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Adams eventually took over the firm but sold it to Holland, Aldwinkle & Slater in 1883.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe motifs and classical figures on these pieces are known as the 'Canova' pattern. The sculptor Antonio Canova (1757-1822) was much admired during the 19th century, particularly after Henry Moses (1782-1870) made engravings of his sculptures, published in 1824. The 'Canova' pattern proved to be popular, and was still in use in the 1880s.",
