Artistically always ahead of her time, her designs are distinctive and innovative. She first trained in illustration and textile design. Her early jewellery, made in the early 1960s with her husband David Watkins, used screen-printed acrylic and paper. In about 1970 she turned to working in silver and gold, rapidly establishing a distinctive minimalist style influenced by modernism and industrial design. \n\nIn 1978, Wendy Ramshaw and David Watkins became Artists in Residence at the Western Australian Institute of Technology in Perth (now Curtin University) sponsored by the Australian Crafts Council.  During this period she became fascinated by Australian Aboriginal art with its decorative and talismanic qualities. It was during this period that Ramshaw began incorporating the feathers which were to feature strongly in her jewellery of the eighties. The feathers were used either in their natural state or cropped or dyed in bright colours. She moved from the metaphor-like application of feathers to a new concept by designing jewellery flamboyant headdresses reflecting punk fashions.",
