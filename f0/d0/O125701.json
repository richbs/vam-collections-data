Apprenticed to a printer at Hull, moved to London 1805, entered the RA Schools 1807 and studied with Sir Thomas Lawrence. Early works were mainly portraits and nude studies; his first large figure composition was 'The Coral Finder' (1820). Exhibited 138 works at the RA between 1811 and 1850, and 77 at the BI 1811-47. Travelled abroad in 1815/6, 1822, and 1830, principally to Paris and Italy. Elected ARA 1824, RA 1828. A retrospective exhibition was held at the Society of Arts 1849. Died York 13 November 1849. His studio sale was at Christie's 6-10 and 13-14 May 1850. Most admired in his lifetime for his large mythological subjects, but now perhaps more appreciated for his less finished and smaller studies of the nude. \n\nLIT: A Gilchrist <i>Life of William Etty</i> 2 vols, 1855; W Gaunt and F G Roe <i>Etty and the Nude</i> Leigh-on-sea 1943; D Farr <i>William Etty</i> 1958 \n\n<b>Study of a Man's Head</b> \n1390-1869 Neg L896 \nPanel, diameter 26.6 cm (10\u00bd ins) \nTownshend Bequest 1869 \n\nDated about 1840-1 by Farr. Presumably the same model as depicted in the 'Head of a Cardinal', (page 82), and perhaps a study for the head of Christ, or connected with the 1838 painting 'The Good Samaritan'. \n\nEXH: <i>British Art</i> 1830-50 Whitechapel Art Gallery 1920 (112) \n\nLIT: <i>Farr</i> no 132, p162\"",
