A portrait of the actor Amitabh Bachchan forms the apex, he is shown holding a cigarette which differentiates him from the other two portraits and also indicates his western/modern character. Emphasis is also placed on his eyes and lips which have become his trademark characteristics. The other two portraits are of the actors Vinod Khanna and Rishi Kapoor.  The title, which is  in a 'Gothic' style typography, is placed in the centre of the three portraits. These faces are surrounded by a montage of smaller images from the film showing violent scenes and couples embracing, all of which indicate the 'formulaic' nature of the film. The entire poster has been 'painted-over' which enhances the facial expressions of the three men and gives a more dramatic effect to the design. This poster is similar to that for the film Kabhi Kabhie, see IS.105-1988.",
