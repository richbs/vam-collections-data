Any number can play, the cards being dealt round until exhausted.  Each player then takes his cards and arranges them as far as possible into families of four.  Each complete familiy forms a trick, which he places face downwards in from of him.  The player to the left of the dealer then commences by asking any player he chooses for any card he may want to make up one of the families he has in his hand.  If that player has it he must give it up, whe the first player can ask again, but if he hasn't the card asked for he replies Not At Home and it then becomes his turn to ask for such cards as he wants.\n2.  A player may not ask for a card of which he has not one of the same family in his hand.\n3.  The game proceeds until all the families are complete, when the player with the most tricks is the winner.\n4.  An addition to the game may at this point be made by the player with the most tricks asking any player for any complete family he may believe him to hold.  If he has it he must pass it over and the first player has another turn for each time he is successful.  If, however, he makes a mistake and asks the wrong player for a trick, the right to ask passes into the other's hands.\nTHE CHAD VALLEY CO LTD., HARBORNE, ENGLAND\n\nGENERAL HAPPY FAMILIES RULES\n\nThree or more can play and special cards are normally used, each showing four members of a family, mother, father, son and daughter,  However, variations have been developed to use groups of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 to a set.  Also subject variations occur and some are educational, for example The Counties of England.\n\nThe object of the game is for each player to collect as many complete 'families' as possible.  \nOne of the players deals out all the cards.  If more than one round is played, the players take it in turn to deal.  It does not matter if some players have one card more than others.\nEach player looks at his cards and sorts them into families.\nIt is important that players keep their cards hidden from each other.  With young children it is a good idea if they can lay their cards out of view of the other players.\nWhen all the players are ready, the person to the dealer's left asks any player, by name, for a particular card (eg Master Baker).  He must already possess at least one of member of the same family, ie Mrs. Baker.  If the person asked has the card, he must give it to the first player, who may again ask anybody for a card of any family as long as he already has one card belonging to that family.  \nHe continues to do this until he fails to obtain a card.  If the person asked does not have the card requested, it is his turn to ask for cards.\nWhen a player collects all the cards of the same family, he puts them into a pile face down in front of him.\nPlay continues until all the families have been completed\nThe winner is the person who collects the most families.",
