The intensity of the colour and the pattern, of auspicious characters in ancient script, increases down the length of the fabric. The pattern is produced using a unique advanced <i>kasuri</i> (weaving with selectively pre-dyed yarns) technique pioneered by Tokiemon Fuji in the 1970s.  Threads are grouped together and these 'blocks' dyed in succesive strips of colour.  These preliminary blocks are then unravelled and the dyed thread woven into patterns of great intricacy.\nThe kimono is lined with plain weave silk of white across shoulders and to below the waist, the rest is in dark plum.",
