In 1972, Woodfox and Herman Wallace were charged with the killing of a prison guard in the notorious Louisiana State Penitentiary, nicknamed Angola and put in solitary confinement. Robert King, a fellow Black Panther Party member was later caught up in connection with their case and also put in solitary confinement.\n\nAfter 29 years in solitary confinement Robert King had his conviction overturned and was released in 2001. Wallace was released in October 2013, only to die three days later. Despite Woodfox having had his original conviction overturned three times, as of 2014 he remains in prison in solitary confinement. Woodfox is the subject of an international campaign, supported by Amnesty International, calling for his immediate release.",
