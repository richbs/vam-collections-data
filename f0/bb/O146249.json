This contract is for the employment of Lily Tuplin in the title role; Tuplin was a popular music hall actress and singer, who had been performing on stage since the age of eight. Her performance in the production was described in reviews from The Era newspaper as \u201c\u2026a graceful Cinderella, whose skirt dancing is much admired\u201d. As in contemporary pantomime, 19th century pantomime incorporated current fads and trends, such as this skirt dancing routine.\n\nThe production also included a celebrity cameo in the person of Lillie Langtry. She played the role of Fairy Diamond, Cinderella\u2019s bestower of wishes. Langtry was a highly successful actress in this country and the USA, and would have been a big draw to this production.\n\nAlthough the costumes for this production were claimed to be designed by Mrs Revill, the manager\u2019s wife, this contract specifies that Miss Tuplin will supply her own \u2018boots, tights, wigs and dresses\u2019.",
