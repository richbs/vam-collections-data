The dress was worn by Lilli Palmer in the 1956 German film 'Teufel in Seide' (Devil in Silk) for which she won 'Best Actress of the Year' award.\n\nA Lanvin dress also in the collection uses the identical silk fabric in a different colourway (with shades of rose pink on a cream ground). However the cut of the Lanvin indicates it was made several years later, in about 1960, suggesting that the fabric was re-issued and taken up by Lanvin without either house realising it had been used/was being reused.
