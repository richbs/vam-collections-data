Fulgence (a dealer, who bid on behalf of the Museum): museum nos. 489-1897 to 517-1897 inclusive.\n\nMuseum staff visited Bonnaff\u00e9's house at Passy on 28/4/1897, before the private view of the sale, with B assisting and offering information on the history of each piece and repairs that had been carried out. 32 pieces were selected for biddign, the 'gem of the collection' being a 'very beautiful piece of French Renaissance furniture - No. 349 - a small credence or cupboard, which we have valued at 10,000 frances (\u00a3400)'. The Museum hoped that George Salting would continue the bidding if/when the bids exceeded the SKM limit, but in the event, neither the Museum nor Salting bought  it.",
