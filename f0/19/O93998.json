Her pose is stabilised by one foot wedged against the wainscoting, and the other against a foot of the mirror. The mirror illuminates her torso and face, offering a different view of her head. Another garment hangs from the mirror, which suggests a narrative in which dressing will take place. It also balances the composition. It was probably not considered improper at the time to exhibit such photographs, at the annual exhibitions of the Photographic Society of London.",

As Lady Hawarden's entries are listed in the Photographic Society of London exhibition catalogues of 1863 and 1864 simply as 'Photographic Studies' and 'Studies from Life', it is no longer possible to determine precisely which of her photographs were exhibited. A contemporary review offers a clue: '[In Lady Hawarden's photographs] there are figures brought close to the window of a room into which pours broad sunlight [...]. In some cases a portion of the window, balcony, and objects beyond is included, and these have sufficient detail to be compatible with atmosphere and distance.' [The Photographic News, 7:99 (1863).] These terms could describe many of Lady Hawarden's photographs. It seem likely that visitors to the Photographic Society exhibitions were aware that the young women in Lady Hawarden's photographs were her daughters. Could this photograph--which shows the Hon. Clementina Maude in a state of undress--have been exhibited? Perhaps. In June 1864, when Lady Hawarden publicly sold some of her photographs to benefit the Female School of Art, a photograph [now in the Gernsheim Collection, University of Texas at Austin] showing her daughter Isabella Grace in a peignoir was bought by Lewis Carroll, who had admired her work in the Photographic Society exhibition. Much speculation has centred on Carroll's penchant for photographing children and young girls, sometimes semi-clothed. Whatever conclusion is now drawn, it seems that at the time most of the parents involved were not unduly concerned. As recorded in his manuscript diaries [British Museum, Add. 54343], Carroll's efforts to become better acquainted with the Maude children were stymied by circumstance. He fared much better wtih Julia Margaret Cameron's family and friends, though initially Carroll prefferred Lady Hawarden's work to that of Mrs. Cameron.
