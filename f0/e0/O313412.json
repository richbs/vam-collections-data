This bust, together with the accompanying bust of his wife, is illustrated in the Blue Hall at Gunnis' home, Hundershall Lodge, just prior to its acquisition by the Museum in 1965.\n\nThe sculptor Samuel Joseph was one of the founding members of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1826, and exhibited there from 1827 until 1844. He worked in London as well as Edinburgh. He specialised in portrait busts and executed some monuments, notably that to William Wilberforce in Westminster Abbey. However, he never achieved the recognition or commissions he arguably deserved, and died almost penniless.",
