Ravanat  Naik's identity is unknown, but he was probably working with them as a draughtsman on the  Pamban Passage clearance; he may have been a Naik / Naigue, a rank equivalent to Corporal  in the Madras Sappers, under Jenkins' command. Jenkins was supervising the Pamban  Passage project, clearing a new shipping channel between the coast of Madras and Sri Lanka.  Their headquarters was only a few miles across the same island as the Temple, and a short  boat trip up river from the Madras coast to the other sites at Madurai.\n\nAlong with seven other watercolours by the same team, and five by Justinian Gantz, this was  presented to the Court of the Honourable East India Company on 16th January 1845 by a  Captain Lock. They were displayed in the India Museum until, in 1878, five were transferred to  the Victoria and Albert Museum. The other watercolours are held in the British Library's India  Office records (WD 557-9). \n\nSince the beginning of the nineteenth century, English soldiers and civil servants had been  collecting information and images of the historic sites in India. In 1800-5, Colonel Mackenzie  had drawings of the temple, and the 'choultry' of Tirumala Nayak at Madurai made for him by  an Indian draughtsman.  The present drawings are significant in illustrating the process by  which Indian artists were recruited to help with military projects and archeological records.   They also demonstrate the draughtsmanship which was an essential skill for military men,  especially ones engaged in engineering projects.",
