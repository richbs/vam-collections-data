            "public_access_description": "The independence movement in Lithuania began in the summer 1988 led by the organisation Sajudis. There followed almost three years of meetings, political actions, demonstrations and protests that loosened the foundations of the Soviet Union\u2019s \u2018empire\u2019. The process was documented by the media, photographers and cinematographers. This poster advertises one of the documentary films that were produced at this time about the Sajudis movement. \n\nThe poster depicts bells ringing out above a gloomy landscape calling Lithuania into battle against Soviet oppression. The bells are decorated with the \u2018Columns of Gediminas\u2019, a motif from the coat of arms of the Lithuanian Grand Dukes of the 14th century, which was adopted as a symbol of Sajudis. The bells are edged with bands of yellow, green and red, the colours of the national flag. The title of the film, Lithuania once again!, recalls the staging of historical dramas by the popular writer Justinas Marcinkevicius during the Soviet period when actors and audience would chant \u201cLie-tu-va!\u2019\u201d (Lithuania) together.\n\nThe poster design was painted in gouache and watercolour and accentuated with charcoal.  The text was hand drawn in white gouache and charcoal.  \n\nGintaras Gesevicius (b. 1952) graduated from the Lithuanian State Art Institute in 1976. During the Soviet period he created memorable posters, book illustrations and paintings. His posters for theatre productions are particularly interesting: for every play he finds original metaphors and symbols to capture the viewer\u2019s eye and interest. His compositions are very painterly, executed in an expressive pastel technique which stands out against the often decorative and non-representational work of other Lithuanian poster designers. His works have been exhibited many times in national and international exhibitions many times.\n\nDuring the years of the Sajudis movement, Gintaras Gesevicius actively collaborated with the organisation\u2019s Initiative Group helping them to create and publish propaganda materials.",
