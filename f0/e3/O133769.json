He soon specialised in mountain paintings especially the Alps, the Bernese Oberland and central Switzerland. He was also a prolific draughtsman and engraver. He died relatively young in Menton, France.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Calame's sketch studies after nature he executed while hiking in the Alps. The painting depicts the surroundings of Villeneuve, a city in the Alps of Haute Provence in France. The present composition combines one of Calame's greatest successes, the depiction of idyllic lake scene (here Lake Lucerne), with the representation of the Alps, which appears to be the main thematic of his oeuvre. This painting does not appear to be a finish version but a preparatory study Calame would rework in his studio.",

He received gold medals at the Paris Salons of 1837 and 1838. In the following year he visited Germany and Holland together with Hornung and in 1845 he was in Italy. After his return he lived in Switzerland, painting Alpine scenery particularly in the Bernese Oberland and at the Lake of the Four Cantons. \nLit. E. Rambert, <i>Alexandre Calame,</i> Paris, 1884; A.

Most of his sketches were sold at the posthumous sale at the H\u00f4tel Drouot, Paris, 12-21 March 1865. \nCalame's sketches from nature, which may be compared with those of the Barbizon School, have found greater favour among some 20th century critics than his more romantic finished works (see for example, Schreiber-Favre, <i>op. cit.,</i> p. 39). \n\nProv.

By A. Calame. Signed. Swiss. Present century'; bequeathed by Rev. Chauncey Hare Townshend, 1868.\n\nHistorical significance: As a fervent Calvinist, Calame used the scenery of the Alps and other mountains to convey the grandiose forces of nature through the depiction of stormy summits and torrents as well as calm and serene lake scenes. This aesthetic is not far from that of the Romantic movement and its use of nature as a mirror of the human and divine mind. The small figure in the foreground, perched on the top of rock is representative of such conception of an overwhelming and omnipotent nature against human fragility.\nThis painting was bequeathed by the Rev. Townshend who owned a large collection of 19th-century landscape paintings. Townshend, who resided part of the year in Lausanne, acquired this painting directly from the artist.",

            "historical_context_note": "The term 'Biedermeier' refers to bourgeois life and art in Germanic Europe, an extensive area embracing such cities as Copenhagen, Berlin, Vienna and Prague, from 1815 (the Congress of Vienna) to the revolutions of 1848. Biedermeier painters were ideologically opposed to academic and religious painting and favoured such subject matter as portraits, landscapes and genre scenes, with still-lifes, especially of flowers. They share a similar technique in the use of separate, clear tones and a high degree of finish, reminiscent of Neo-Classicism while they tend to convey a greater sentimentality. By the 1880s, the influence of this artistic movement was on the wane and was even used pejoratively to characterize the reactionary bourgeois elements in society, which remained quite indifferent to social problems and cultivated a sense of order and sobriety, especially in the private sphere and the domestic realm.",
