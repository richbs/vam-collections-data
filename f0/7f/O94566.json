Presentation pieces offered silversmiths the chance to display their technical wizardry. The Illustrated London News trumpeted in 1850, 'It is the art that ennobles the metal, not the metal the art ... even pewter or lead, upon which has been impressed the stamp of genius is beyond comparison, more worthwhile the racing for, than any tawdry work in silver whose true worth is at per ounce. Frosting, matting, parcel-gilding and burnishing have all been used to create contrasting surface textures on this cup.\n\nStephen Smith and Son's business descended from Digby Scott and Benjamin Smith, who along with Paul Storr, were the main suppliers to the great Regency firm of Rundell, Bridge and Rundell. The accuracy of the detailing on the foliage and horses heads and on the St. George and dragon finial, suggest a Rundells heritage. However, Stephen Smith's work was more restrained than that of his father, Benjamin Smith II, and his use of naturalism was more confined to decoration than form.\n\nVariations of the handles of this cup appear on British Grand Prix trophy, a more traditional cup form, and a similar trophy, the Monmouthshire Gun Club Challenge Cup, also made by Stephen Smith and Son.\n\nQuotes:\n\n'In no branch of the fine arts have the artists of this country made greater progress than in the art of modelling statuettes, and more particularly in modelling groups in which horses and animals are introduced ... It may indeed be called a national art, and a national manufacture, by which such beautiful and classic illustrations of ancient fables, and of historical events, have been made the means of decorating vases, cups and such like prizes'. Illustrated London News, 1850\n\n'It is time we had more variety and more utility introduced into these large and generally useless masses of silver, which are now simply memorials of the triumph of a particular racehorse.'
