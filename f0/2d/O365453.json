Twisted around each one is a trunk with grapes in silver thread, whose texture contrasts with the surface of the column. Between the two columns, at intervals, are clusters of exotic fruit and leaves also in metal thread. Delicate semi-naturalistic flowers in coloured silks, their stems and leaves lemon yellow and the flowers in shades of pink, blue and white, are growing from these clusters. Vine leaves and tendrils in lemon yellow decorate the trunks twisted round the columns. There are two comber, or straight repeats in the width. Edged with a border of gold braid. Lined with apple green watered silk.\n\nThe ground has a pattern in gros de tours on a warp-faced satin of eight ground. The coloured silk and metal thread wefts are brocaded. Two kinds of metal thread are used. Paired shoots of silver gilt fil\u00e9 form the columns and part of the clusters of fruit. Single shoots of silver gilt fris\u00e9 form the trunk of the vine and grapes. Both are wound on a yellow silk core. The brocaded wefts are bound in 3/1 twill by a proportion of the warp threads used in pairs.",
