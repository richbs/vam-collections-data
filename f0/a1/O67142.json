Upper: 52\" (14 cms) of bands with the same colours.  Both ends have warp fringe with one row of knots.\n\nDESIGN: Field: dark pink ground divided into a lattice with star-like guls. There are 2 rows of 7 of these, 6 pairs have a rosette within an octagon, the lowest pair have a stepped diamond, not a rosette and there are other design inconsistencies in this area.  The 6 pairs have outlined in yellow or white which extend as bars ending in a pair of horns horizontally and almost touching vertically, giving the appearance of a grid.  The green and blue 'lattice' which crosses beneath the guls is infact two rows of double zigzags enclosing green or blue triangles surrounded by small 3-pronged motifs in yellow and blue or white and green.  In the lowest quarter of the carpet, where green is used in place of dark green, it would seem that the weavers had yet to determine the precise design.  At the top of the field are two bands of 16 squares, each halved by stepped diagonal lines.\nMain border: white ground with a dark brown central line on which are placed multi-coloured rosettes.\nInner and outer borders: diagonal blocks of colour which, half way along on the inner border, become interlocking Y-motifs.  A few of these appear in the right hand outer border.\n\nDate catalogued: 10.7.96",
