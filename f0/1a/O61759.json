The pain and anguish is visible on her face and this is enhanced through the technique of 'over-painting' which has been applied to the whole poster. Radha is set again a sunset and in the background we see a line of people roughly drawn leading off into the horizon. This is a key scene from the film in which the villagers are all ready to abandon their land and  leave their recently flooded village. It is Radha who persuades them to stay. The entire poster is in rich shades of reds, oranges and browns.\n\nThe image is taken from the souvenir booklet which was released at the same time as the film. The original image was designed/painted by L.L. Meganee who was responsible for many early film posters and booklets. Seth Studios enlarged and enhanced this image for a later re-release of the film.",
