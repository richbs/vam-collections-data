It is signed by the three managers of the theatre, all of whom were also actors - Robert Wilks (1665-1732), Colley Cibber (1671-1757) and Barton Booth (1681-1733).  The actor Thomas Doggett (1670-1721), a former partner, had retired in disgust when his enemy Booth was allowed a share in the theatre.\n\nThe bill relates to alterations for costumes in the play The Amorous Widow presented at Drury Lane in 1715. This copy was probably made and kept at the theatre for accounting purposes, since it is one of a group of similar items.",
