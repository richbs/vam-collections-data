            "bibliography": "Ward-Jackson, Peter, Italian Drawings Volume I. 14th-16th century, London, 1979, p. 189. The text is as follows: Design for a tapestry with playing boys Pen and ink and wash heightened with white 8 \u00be x 13 (222 x 330) D.8-1885 PROVENANCE Bought 1885 The drawing shows a putto standing on a sphere within a basket plucking down human masks from the branches of a tree and handing them to two companions seated on baskets on each side of him; behind, a festoon of fruit and flower stretched between two pendants. The drawing is much faded, damages and restored, but enough remains to show that thte design is connected with a series of tapestries which Pope Leo X commissioned in 1520 from the Flemish weaver Pieter van Aelst for the Sala di Constantino in the Vatican. These tapestries, known as \u2018the playing boys\u2019, are traditionally attributed to Raphael, but the cartoons were probably prepared by Giovanni d Udine or Tommaso Vincidor. According to Vasari, Giovanni da Udine was the artist, but there is a letter dates 20 July 1521, in which Vincidor informs the Pope that he has made cartoons for twenty pieces of tapesty decorated with \u2018putini\u2019. The letter was first published by M\u00fcntz in the Athenaeum, 11 July 1896, and is exstentively quoted in the subsequent literature. The case for Giovanni da Udine is argued by E. Diez in an article in the Prussian Fahrbuch, 31, 1910, 00. 30-9. Fischel supports the claim of Vincidor in the same journal, 55, 1934, pp. 89-96. Our drawing is so badly damaged that it is virtually impossisble to asses its quality. If it is compared with the drawing in the Louvre which Fischel attributes to Vincidor (loc. cit., fig. 1), it appears to be in the same atyle, but inferior, and therefore probably a copy. The same conclusion will be drawn if it is compared with the hour similar Vincidor designs in Munich (nos. 2552, 2553, 2554a and 2554b.) and the drawing in the British Museum (Pouncey and Gere, p. 87, no. 155). But the drawing is of some interest because it reproduced a design hitherto unrecorded. All the original tapestries have been lost, but the designs of four are represented in four engravings by the Master of the Die (bartsch, 15, pp. 208-09, nos. 32-5), while the others are reproduced in a number of drawings and later weavings. The subjects represented in the remainder can to some extent be deduced from an old inventory in the Vatican and from other documentary sources. The theme of our drawing does not correspond with that of any of the surviving drawings or tapestries, nor does it answer to any of the descriptions given in the documents, unless it is connected with the tapestry indicated in the inventory by the title \u2018un putto sopra un arbour di mela\u2019. A summary of what is known about these tapesty designs is given in Pouncey and Gere, pp. 87-90.",
