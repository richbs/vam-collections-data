As such, it also echoes the thinking behind the new galleries. It reflects the statement by J. C. Robinson, first curator of the South Kensington Museum (now V&A), that knowledge gained from the Museum will not inhibit but inspire originality for 'he who knows most will be the most original'. On the obverse of the medal is the tree of knowledge and of life, while the flash of lightning on the reverse symbolises inspiration. \n\nThe commemorative function of this medal, its iconography, the artist's methods of creation as well as the aesthetic and philosophical qualities of this object reflect the Renaissance practice of medal-making.",

As such, it also echoes the thinking behind the new Medieval and Renaissance galleries. \nThe commemorative function of this medal, its iconography, the artist\u2019s methods of creation (a wax model on mirror back echoeing the Renaissance production of wax models on slate) as well as the aesthetic and philosophical qualities of this object fittingly reflect the Renaissance practice of medal-making. It is closely related to the artist\u2019s wax reliefs on mirror backs, as the reverse is taken from \u2018Lightning on Sea\u2019, a piece Felicity Powell exhibited at Domobaal gallery in 2009. \n\nFelicity Powell (born 1961) creates small-scale sculpture, building on long established traditions to produce thoughtful objects with a distinctively poetic resonance. The formal qualities of the object, in the delicacy of the relief and resulting subtle effects of light and shadow, illustrate the artist\u2019s commitment to the excellence of medal-making.",
