It was named after Grafton Way near Tottenham Court Road in London, the location of Sommaruga's first premises.  The idea to create a saxophone from acrylic was initially based on the cost, working out approximately half the price of a brass equivalent.\n\nThe Grafton was patented in 1945, with commercial production running from 1950 to 1967.  It was the model played by jazz musicians Ornette Coleman and Charlie Parker, and was also the first musical instrument owned by David Bowie when aged 14.",
