Pedigree had a long history of making dolls and wanted to branch out with a teenage doll. Sindy was one of many teenage fashion dolls reflecting wider popular culture and was nicknamed 'the girl you love to dress'. It's believed that she was the first UK toy product to feature on a 30-second TV commercial. She had a girlish figure and flat shoes at first, with a head of big, curly blonde hair. \n\nThe \"Funtime\" Sindy was produced from 1973 onwards by Pedigree. Sindy is now mainly a line of girls' accessorise produced by New Moons.",
