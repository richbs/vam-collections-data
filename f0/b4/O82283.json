They were influenced by the French fashion for formal dining and a greater emphasis on soups, stews and sauces. This example may have had an accompanying ladle and dish.\n\nDesign\nThe fashion for organic naturalism, in which animal or plant forms become not only the ornament but also the structure of the object, was an integral part of the Rococo style on the Continent, but was less utilised in England. It was popularised by the ornamental prints of such masters as the French designer and goldsmith Juste-Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier (1695-1750). The maker of this sauce boat, Philip Bruguier (active 1739-1773), was a Huguenot and was undoubtedly influenced by the leading Continental goldsmiths working in London in a full expression of the Rococo style.\n\nTime\nAlthough there were close links between metalwork and ceramics in mid-18th century Britain,  organic forms were found more often in ceramics. In the 1750s porcelain was modelled by the Chelsea and Longton Hall factories in such naturalistic forms as plants, vegetables, fruits and marine life.",
