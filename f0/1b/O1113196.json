They were presented to patrons in the most expensive seats as a luxurious souvenir. This may well have been produced for the first night of Trilby at London's Theatre Royal Haymarket on Wednesday 30th October 1895. The play was adapted from the best-selling novel of the same name by George Du Maurier and had previously been seen for a try-out run at the Theatre Royal Manchester, where it had opened on 7th September 1895. \n\nThe cast printed on this playbill is the same as that advertised in The Times the previous day. Later in the run, which lasted until 27 May 1896, the role of Little Billee was played by H.V. Esmond.. Herbert Beerbohm Tree and Dorothea Baird both became celebrated for their characters Svengali and Trilby O'Farrell, and as owner of the theatre, director of the play and star actor, Trilby also made Herbert Beerbohm Tree a very sizeable profit.",
