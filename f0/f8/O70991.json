            "public_access_description": "This superbly modelled harlequin is one of the great early small-scale works by the artist who largely defined the sculptural conventions of the eighteenth-century porcelain figure: Johann Joachim K\u00e4ndler. K\u00e4ndler, the greatest porcelain modeller of the century, had been recruited for  the Meissen factory by Augustus the Strong to create models for his life-size porcelain  menagerie at Dresden. After excelling at large-scale work, he turned his attention to small  figures in the later 1730s, in doing so inventing the porcelain figure as we know it today. He went  on to create or supervise the creation of about 1,000 models during his remarkably long career,  including figures for collectors\u2019 cabinets and interior decoration, but also for display at grand  dinners.\n\nIn the 1740s K\u00e4ndler devised a wide range of porcelain figures for table decoration. The most popular figures he made however, were probably characters from the Italian Opera, the Commedia dell'Arte, which was a popular satirical travelling theatre, from which the miniature Punch and Judy developed in the 1800s. These figures are not in fact recorded as having been used as table decoration and it is possible they were commissioned by individuals or made on K\u00e4ndler's own initiative.\n\nK\u00e4ndler portrayed the colourful figure of Harlequin in many postures and guises.  Although this figure of Harlequin has the black half-mask typically associated with the character,  he was often depicted without any mask, adding exaggerated facial features, moustaches,  black patches and warts instead. Like most of K\u00e4ndler\u2019s Italian Comedy models, this figure was  a virtuoso cabinet piece for collectors. K\u00e4ndler evidently keenly enjoyed the expressive  grimaces and contorted poses of Italian Comedy actors, not to mention their bawdy humour, clearly alluded to here by the sausage and cherry he is holding.",

            "history_note": "In the 2001 Stuttgart exhibition catalogue (see reference below), Ulrich Pietsch  gives an account of the production of Italian comedy figures at Meissen .  There is  a short essay, translated by Sebastian Kuhn, in the English summary within the  slip cover of the main catalogue from which the following information is taken.\n\nK\u00e4ndler was appointed as modeller in 1731 at the Meisen factory.  His first  Commedia figure was in 1736 and depicted Harlequin with the bagpipes and a dog  at his feet.  There followed many different variations on the different characters.\n\n'K\u00e4ndler's intentions in creating such comedy types are as little known as who  commissioned them.  They appear not to have been used at all as table  decoration, either on the royal dining tables or those of Graf Br\u00fchl, as the  inventory of the royal 'Hof-Conditorei' (Court Confectioner) and the 'Herrn Premier- Ministre Reichs Grafen von Br\u00fchl Excellenz Conditorey' do not list a single figure of  this type.  These figures must be traced back to commissions by individuals, and  many may have been made to commissions by individuals, and many may have  been made on K\u00e4ndler's own initiative.'\n\n'The sources which inspired K\u00e4ndler's fantasy were, on the one hand, the theatre performances themselves which he evidently frequently attended, and on the other, the engravings, which also provided him inspiration for other works.  Among these should be mentioned an engraving by Joullain from Louis Riccoboni's 'Histoire du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Italien' (Paris, 1728), which depicts on plate 2 a Harlequin with a sausage and slapstick, which K\u00e4ndler turned into a masterly porcelain figure, add above all, engravings after paintings by Watteau, such as 'D\u00e9part des Com\u00e9diens italiens', on which the deeply bowing Harlequin is based.  Watteau's 'Gilles' is also reflected in the design of K\u00e4ndler's Pierrot.'\n\nWhen considering any of K\u00e4ndler's Commedia dell'Arte figures, the sculptor's  delight in his subject matter is there to be seen in his expressive modelling,  exaggerated poses, enhanced by the models' brilliant colouring:\n\n'Invention and experience - derived from pictorial sources as well as from nature -  are thus combined in an excellent and striking work of art.  Ignoring the spirit of  the Enlightenment, and the fact that the Italian Comedy was barely maintained in  Saxony after the Seven Years War, K\u00e4ndler continued to create new models of  comedy figures until shortly before his death in 1775, apparently in response to  lively demand.  In spite of Johann Joachim Winckelmann's indignation at the 'vulgar  taste of works in porcelain' which was mostly 'formed into ridiculous dolls', a  greater part of courtly society adhered to the aesthetic conceptions of the late  Baroque much later than has often been assumed, particularly in the area of the  decorative arts.'",
