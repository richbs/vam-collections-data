First the sculptor carved the rough shape of the piece, a process known as \u2018blocking out\u2019. Then, he would work the surface with knives or chisels and abrasives. The figure was generally held horizontally at a workbench and attached to cylindrical shafts, so the sculptor could turn the piece as he carved. Small-scale pieces were generally carved at a workbench.\n\nThis tool is part of twenty-two wood-carving tools and forms a set selected by a wood-sculptor from four manufacturers - 1. S J ADDIS / CAST STEEL / ENGLAND, 2. HERRING BROTHERS, 3. C. HILL, and 4. WARD. The wood handle of the tools is of the 'Kensington type' in the turned form, except A. 3:6-1992 which is of an octagonal form. Some of the blades have a particular number which indicates the length of the blade and the cross section according to an old trade practice. The tools were probably those of Mrs. Bickerdike's late husband, J. M. (Micky) Bickerdike, who was taught by Gaudier-Brzesak, and was a sculptor himself.",
