Most of these art works take the form of billboards or posters. It began with the redundant District Line platform at Gloucester Road station, which has hosted a series of billboards. Other Platform for Art projects in 2004 have included Mark Titchner, Muntean/Rosenblum and Emma Kay.\n\nSimon Bedwell created four sets of posters for Piccadilly Circus station, using ClipArt and WordArt software, available to almost everybody with a computer. The images draw on a wide range of visual materials including promotional blurbs, local newspaper headlines, \u201850s photography and Communist-bloc advertising. The project was a joint commission between Platform for Art and the Institute of Contemporary Art, to coincide with Becks futures 2004 (Bedwell was one of the shortlisted artists).\n\nThis is a circuit poster, used at locations across the tube network to advertise the Platform for Art projects to travellers.",
