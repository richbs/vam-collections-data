They would have been worn with his court robes (for an example see IM.43-1912 or IM.44-1912) on state occasions. \n\nGradations of rank at the Burmese court were indicated by how many strands or chains the sal-we consisted of. The peacock depicted on three of the clasps symbolized the sun and was the emblem of the Konbaung Dynasty (1752-1885). The minister's titles are inscribed on the shwe pyar and red ribbons would have been attached to the ends allowing the decoration to be tied around the minister's forehead when entering the King's presence.",
