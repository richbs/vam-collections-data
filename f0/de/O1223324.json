He acted at the Lyceum in his youth, using the name Bernard Gould, and made many drawings of Irving, some which appeared in the theatre's souvenir programmes. His work has provided both a record of costumes and scenery and of the dramatic effect of Irving's performances.\n\nThis image shows the actor Henry Irving (1838-1905) in his 1895 adaptation of King Arthur. It was commissioned as a vehicle in which he could star with Ellen Terry as Guinevere, written by James Comyns Carr, and was performed on a spectacular scale, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.\n\nThe sets, costumes and props were designed by Edward Burne-Jones, who had worked on numerous art works with an Arthurian theme, including paintings, murals and his stained-glass panels for Harden Grange, in Yorkshire. Comyns Carr asked Burne-Jones to design the production whilst the artist was working on his magnum opus, The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon.",
