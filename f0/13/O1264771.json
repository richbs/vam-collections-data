            "public_access_description": "Joan\u2019s chair has been newly acquired by the V&A Museum of Childhood in Bethnal Green.  It is an important Arts & Crafts piece dating from 1901.  The chair was designed by Ambrose Heal and built by Heal and sons.  The heavy set chair is made of oak and is decorated with inlay work believed to be designed by Christine Angus, wife of Walter Sicket and sister to Joan.   The V&A collection holds extensive examples of work from the Arts & Craft Movement, including artworks, textiles, and furniture as well as the Heals & sons Archive held at Blythe house donated in 1978.  Such examples of high quality design made specifically for a child are very rare finds.\n\nThe chair was commissioned by Joseph Angus, for his youngest child, Joan Drummond Angus.  The Angus family originally from Scotland, settled in New Castle upon Tyne in 1584, in the leather business.  The family business was successful until its take over by Dunlop in 1968.  The chair was one of a number of pieces the family commissioned from Ambrose Heal.  The fact that this piece was commission for the youngest child of the family indicates that she was highly regarded by her family.  The family were artistic and there are several portraits of Joan, still held by the family.  Joan was born in 1896 the youngest of ten children; the chair was made for her when she was five years old.  She died of tuberculosis, seven years later aged 12 in 1908.  The chair has an ecclesiastical feel, fumed oak and dome shaped with inlaid that includes winged cherubs, a lily and a rose motifs all suggest a memorial one might see depicted in a stain-glass or even a head stone.  The high backed proportions of the chair allow the inlay work to be visible even when the child is sitting within it.  The back of the chair is decorated with a design in inlay work that gives the date of the chair as 1901, hidden within a monogram.\n\nJoan\u2019s oldest sister Christine who designed the inlay work was a student at the Slade School of Fine Art and a pupil of Walter Sicket, whom she married in 1911.  It was also while she was at Slade that she befriended Edith Todhunter who married Ambrose Heal in 1904.  This connection led to Christine producing a number of designs for Heal & Sons, including this chair.  Within the Heals archive held by the V&A, a pencil drawing by Ambrose has been found with a note that says the piece of furniture should include decorative inlay work \u2018preferably by Miss Angus\u2019.\n\nThis chair has stayed with the Angus family up until now and has an extremely well documented history.  The chair was exhibited at the V&A in 1952 (Exhibition of Victorian & Edwardian Decorative Arts) and at the Centenary Exhibition of Works by Sir Ambrose Heal, Heals, Tottenham Court Road in 1972.  It also featured in Country Life in 1984 and well as several other publications.  \n\nThe chair is a strong addition to the museum\u2019s furniture collections, not only as a fine example of the Decorative Arts of this period but also as an important story of childhood.",
