Cixi was the mother of Emperor Tongzhi (reigned 1862-1874) and aunt of Emperor Guangxu (reigned 1875-1908). She effectively ruled China for much of the late 19th century. \n\nAfter the riots of the anti-foreign Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Cixi made great efforts to amend China's diplomat relationships with the Western nations by entertaining the diplomats and their wives, missionaries and other foreign guests in the Forbidden City. The painting, with Cixi's seal affixed on the top, was given to Frau Olga Julia Wegener, the wife of a German diplomat who served in China from 1906 to 1908.",
