There is often very little difference in shape and use between Muslim and Christian jewellery, but the decoration clearly shows the identity of the wearer.\n\nThis amulet case is very similar in design to Muslim amulet cases throughout the eastern Mediterranean region, but the embossed image of St George and the dragon identifies it as Christian, probably from Albania or Greece, where St George was the patron saint.  Boxes like this were frequently worn by freedom fighters in the Greek War of Independence, and sometimes have symbols on the back, identifying the owner as the member of one of the numerous societies established to push for Greek independence.  It was bought for the Museum for \u00a31 6s. at the International Exhibition, London, in 1872, when it was described as Albanian.",
