Galpin of Charmouth, Dorset describing his process which earned him the Society's Silver Isis medal.  He proposed a new method of producing drawings by applying powdered black lead to paper with a brush or the pith of common elder.  In some cases stencils made out of card were used to enable a drawing to be produced in multiple copies.  \"When a number of copies of the same subject are required the definite shapes are produced first with the brushes, through corresponding apertures cut in three or four guides, made in thin card, of the precise size of drawing, beginning with the darkest and including the last in each succeeding guide: the apertures in the guides comprise the principle masses of shade, and the lights are protected by the intervening parts\" Trans. of the Society of Arts, vol. 44, p.37.",
