            "public_access_description": "These stained glass panels were made in the workshop of Thomas of Oxford who was commissioned by William of Wykeham, Bishop of Winchester (1366-1404), to make decorated windows for his educational establishments of Winchester College, Winchester, and New College, Oxford. Thomas of Oxford was an important glazier at the end of the 14th century and on into the early years of the 15th century. He headed a stained glass workshop which was probably located in Oxford or just outside the city. A document dated 1393 discusses the contract for the Winchester windows and these panels date from that time.\n\nThese three panels were originally located in the side windows closest to the altar in the Chapel of Winchester College. The east window of this Chapel was filled with glass depicting the genealogy of Jesus Christ in the form of a 'Tree of Jesse'. The side windows contained images of saints, the twelve Apostles and Old Testament prophets. The figures here represent the Apostles St John the Evangelist and St James the Less and the Old Testament prophet Ezekiel. \n\nBetween 1821 and 1828, the Chapel windows were taken down to be restored by the firm of Betton and Evans of Shrewsbury. However, the firm decided to replace the originals with copies. The V&A\u2019s panels are original and were purchased from the studio by the Rev. W.G. Rowland who intended to install them in St. Mary\u2019s Shrewbury but instead sold them. In 1855, the museum bought them from the current owner.\n\nThis figure of the prophet Ezekiel stands on a pedestal base which bears the name of Sophonias. It is believed that during the restoration in the early 19th century, the section of glass bearing the name \u2018Sophonias\u2019 was mistakenly inserted into the base of the panel with the figure of Ezekiel.",
