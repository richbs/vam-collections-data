At the base of the central panel are two corner triangles with a lobed outline and a white ground which is decorated with a dark floral stem bearing red, pink and green flowers including carnations, irises and large rosebuds with yellow and blue details. This pattern is repeated on a white ground in the spandrels.  In between the two corners is a shallow tray in blue and white with a small yellow vase standing in the centre, this is decorated with a rigid floral stem. Either side of the vase is a long narrow serrated leaf and a large rosette emerging from a very small vase and tray; the rosette is  outlined in two shades of blue and filled with 3 blossoms in red and purple.  There is a similar large rosette emerging from the large yellow vase. The rest of the field is densely packed with straight and curving floral sprays. Below the apex of the arch is another rosette edged in purple and white with a central yellow roundel decorated with a flowering stem.\nAcross the top and bottom is a narrow band [a] with a white ground and a thin purple meander bearing a blossom in four variations in green, red and blue.  Down the sides there is a definite white stripe with a more delicate green stemmed meander bearing buds and flowers in 6 variations; this is repeated as the outer stripe.  In between is a wide chevron band with three variations of a floral spray on either yellow, red or purple ground each separated by a narrow white chevron with a floral purple meander.  This chevron pattern is carried across the top and bottom; at the top there is a repeat of band [a] and a final border which had been pieced and added.  The lower border has also been added.\nThe whole has a thin interlining of loose cotton fibres through which it is quilted.  It was then backed with a pieced, undecorated red cotton twill.\nWarp: white, dark red and black wool\nWeft: dark red, red, pink, yellow, green, blue, white, black wool.",
