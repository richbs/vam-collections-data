            "public_access_description": "The netsuke is a toggle. Japanese men used netsuke to suspend various pouches and containers from their sashes by a silk cord. Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this netsuke of an oni (demon) hiding from a shower of thrown peas. \n\nIn Japanese folklore oni are devious creatures with an ugly appearance capable of causing mischief and misfortune. Throwing peas at an oni was thought to make the malevolent creature blind, as depicted in this netsuke of a demon desperately attempting to hide under a hat. On the 4th February the exorcism ritual of Setsubun is held where peas are thrown inside and outside the house to expel evil demons that may be lurking around a residence.",
