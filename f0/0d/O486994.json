Three silk-cr\u00eape bands run round the base, coloured red, white and purple crossed obliquely by gilt threads. These terminate at the back in a bow fastened by gilt-edged chrysanthemum and hang down behind as three pairs of streamers. The front is decorated with a piece of red cloth of wavy outline edged with silk and gilt braid. The deep neck-flaps of red cloth, lined with green satin, are embroidered with butterflies in green and white silk. The edges are covered with gilt braid. Decorated on both sides with the crest of the Honda family. The crest occupies the middle of either neck-flap and is embroidered in white silk. The deeper shoulder-flaps of purple cloth, lined with green satin, are furnished with two buttons attached to brown silk cords, and with two loops of the same material. The patterns on the shoulder-flaps, in gilt-thread and coloured silks, consist of chrysanthemums and bamboo stems. Furnished with a couple of tying strings of purple silk-cr\u00eape stuffed with cotton wool. Possibly worn by actors or in Noh dances.",
