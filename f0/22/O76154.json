            "public_access_description": "Lez Brotherston (born 1961) trained at the Central School of Art and Design, graduating in 1984. He is an influential and innovative designer of film, theatre and opera, and is especially known for his work for dance, particularly for Matthew Bourne's companies, Adventures in Motion Pictures and New Adventures. He has designed Bourne's productions of Highland Fling, an up-dating of Les Sylphides set in a Glasgow council flat, Cinderella, which took place during the London Blitz, The Car Man, based on Bizet's opera Carmen, Edward Scissorhands, and, famously, Swan Lake with male swans, for which he won three awards.\n\nBrotherston has a long association with Northern Ballet Theatre, designing, almost others, Giselle, The Bront\u00ebs, A Christmas Carol, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Dracula. The Bront\u00ebs was choreographed by Gillian Lynne who devised it with Northern Ballet Theatre's artistic director, Christopher Gable, in 1995. It tells the story of the Bront\u00eb sisters, as seen through the eyes of their father Patrick, in an impressionist narrative which covers over 40 years in 22 short scenes.\n\nA designer will create a 'bible' to contain the information required by costumiers and set builders. This example gives an insight into Brotherston's working methods. The costume designs are colour copies of his original drawings, with attached samples of fabrics and trimmings, and many designs incorporate reproductions of the source material, such as 19th century prints or fashion plates, as an aid to the makers. Brotherston always focuses on the costumes not the wearers, using a few standard poses for his figures, drawing the faces in profile and giving them all similar features. Design bibles usually include set designs, but Brotherston's only contains costume as he does not produce set designs on paper. He prefers to create models and develop the set in three dimensions.  At the front of the bible are a series of photographs of the finished model which shows how one basic setting can be adapted to suggest different locations.",
