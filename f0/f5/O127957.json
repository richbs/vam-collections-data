From 1964-65 she was assistant to Archie Brennan at the Edinburgh Tapestry Company, and went on to become Head of Tapestry at Edinburgh College of Art.  Hodge is interested in the act of construction, both physically and conceptually.  Tapestry weaving requires the construction of a warp and a weft and results in an image that is not just on the surface but lives throughout the structure of the tapestry.  In addition to the physical act of weaving, construction is required for sorting and organising initial concepts and ideas in order to carry them through to fruition on the loom.  Hodge sketches her images from nature, recreating the freedom of her initial drawings through an intuitive and skillful use of yarns and fibres.  In Hills and Skies of Love, Hodge has combined a seemingly random use of Persian knots and Turkish tufting with a regimented grid of squares to create an sense of order which is typical of her work.  It was her first design to be woven at the Edinburgh Tapestry Company.",
