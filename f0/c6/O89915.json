The figures are hand painted with pink bodies, heads and limbs, and dark brown boots with white laces. One has red shorts; the chest and chin are mottled with brown and black paint to represent hair.The other figure wears an all in one blue leotard. Both figures have painted facial features including a red finger print on each cheek, and a single silver earring. The \"blue\" wrestler has a tuft of black plush fabric glued to the top of his head; the \"red\" wrestler has an auburn coloured tuft. A length of red cord runs through the clasped hands with a knot separating the two arm sections. There is a turned wooden knob at each end of the cord. When the cord is pulled taut the figures fight and kick each other. The figures are contained in the original cardboard box with lid.",
