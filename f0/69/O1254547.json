            "public_access_description": "This delightful jelly mould is in two parts and bears witness to the elegant dining habits of the late 1700s as the edible jelly dish created in it was intended purely for display as part of the dessert course.  The fancy core mould would sit inside the plain outer mould (presumably supported in a special holder until the jelly set) and liquid jelly was poured through the four holes in the rim.  Once the jelly was set, the two moulds with the jelly inside were turned back up the right way and set on a serving dish.  Then the plain outer mould was removed, revealing the pretty painted decoration shimmering through the stiff, clear jelly.  'Pyramid moulds' such as this were often disposed in pairs as part of an elaborate symmetrical arrangement of dishes.\nMaking completely clear jelly was a difficult and time-consuming task in itself.  Gelatine could be made from boiling calves' or pigs' feet, adding beaten egg whites, wine and lemon juice.  Alternatively two other congealing agents could be used: isinglass, derived from the swim bladders of certain fish, or hartshorn, literally gratings from the horns of deer.  \nTwo-part moulds of this type seem to have been popular from about 1780-1810.",

            "history_note": "This type of jelly mould was designed to sit on the table with the painted core showing through an outer pyramid of stiff jelly.  According to Robin Emmerson, they were popular only from about 1780-1810.\nJoan Morris in her article 'Molds and their History' cites Parson Woodforde's diary (1782), writing of a dinner he attended, 'and a very pretty pyramid of jelly in the centre, a landscape appearing thro' the jelly, a new device and brought from London.' p. 146.  She also illustrates a very similar core mould, fig. 13, in the collection of Mrs. Henry P. Bridges (USA).\n'Today these molds are referred to as core molds, but in their day they were known as pyramids as we learn from a contemporary document in the Wedgwood Museum 'A Mould for Jelly, a Square Pyramid with cover to fit with five holes in it to pour the Jelly through, and the Middle part is left in the Jelly and showing the painting through the Jelly.'  There is an order of 1786 which indicates that they may have been sold in pairs: 'Mr Wedgwoods, Greek Street, London, 8 small Pyramid Moulds of 4 sorts, two alike.'",
