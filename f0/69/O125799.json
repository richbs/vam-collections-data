ISBN: 1854375830.\nExhibition catalogue.\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 121, 124\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\nThe drawing is on thin paper which has been laid on card.  The surface of the drawing is damaged in places and the repairs are carried out on the card and extended over to the original drawing; this suggests that the mounting and repair were the work of the artist.  It has been considered practicable to remove the drawing from the card to examine the back.\n\nThe main lines of the composition in bistre are the same as those in the oil sketch No. 174 [322-1888] and the drawing may therefore have been made at approximately the same time.  It differs in details, such as the height of the terrace on the left, the terrace architecture and the absence of the large barge in the foreground.  Possibly it was the sketch from wich No. 174 [322-1888] was made; but there are no indications that the drawing was copied by the artist from the oil sketch in order to try out the effect of the pencil alterations in the left foreground.  The main result of these is to give the principal tree a higher crown and more elongated appearance.  This effect does not occur in No. 174 [322-1888] nor in the large oil study in the collection of Lord Fairhaven, but something similar is to be found in the exhibited picture of 1832.  Sutton (<i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 251) inclines to the same view.",
