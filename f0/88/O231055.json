One panel forms the upper back, goes over the shoulders [there are no seams] and forms the upper front part. A small circular hole for the neck has been cut with a slit to almost] the waist level. Panels of the same fabric have been added to form the lower back [which has a long repaired slit], two almost triangular panels per side, a narrow rectangular panel over the shoulders and three panels per long, straight sleeve. The lower front panel, which is pieced down the right hand side, is brocaded with four offset bands of a very stylized floral spray with 3 carnations, alternately dark blue and white with light blue leaves or light blue and white with dark green leaves. The ground is filled with metal thread leaves and spots. The metal thread is silver strip open S-wound on a yellow silk core with twill binding. There is a woven border along the bottom: 'gold' ground with purple scrolling stems and flowerheads and split leaves. The right hand section has a stitched-on ribbon [see sleeves]. The panel which forms the upper front and back was woven to shape with 3 pairs of the same flowers and a delicate border either side of the slit and around the neck: fine gold line connecting a purple cross, a light blue S-motif and small gold leaves.\nThe ribbon along part of the front hem and around the end of each sleeve is light beige-grey twill ground with curling leaves and flowers in pink and light green.\nThe embroidered edging is in black and white silk.\nThe blouse fastens at the neck with a cord loop on the right and a round white metal button on the left.\nThe neck slit is faced with a narrow piece of pink and white checked silk.",
