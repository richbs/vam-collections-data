            "physical_description": "Design:  Field: dark red ground with two rows of thin white spiralling stems on which perch birds and hand composite blossoms and over which there are large cloud bands (brocaded).  Beneath the white spirals is a tangle of narrow dark green stems with small blossoms, rosettes and buds.  There is a central line of composite palmette-like blossoms and two and two half lines of smaller versions on the horizontal axis.  NOTE: two long-tailed birds in the upper half were originally woven with detailed markings - stripes or checks?\n\nMain border: very dark green ground with a dark red stem forming a meander with large palmettes and blossoms.  A green stem links smaller blossoms with additional spirals with small blossoms, buds and leaves.\n\nInner border: very light green ground with red meander and orange diagonal leaves and red, white or blue flowers and a fine black line forming a double meander.\n\nOuter border: dark red ground with a double meander with a dark green stem and light red stem.  The latter bears green or dark yellow/blue blossoms and the dark green stem has a sprig of 3 small white flowers.\n\nWarp:  white silk, yellow in places; Z2S; 34-39 threads per inch (136-160 per dm); depressed.\n\nWeft: Foundation: white cotton; Z2S = middle, sinuous shoot, Z-spun, unplied, 2 parallel threads - first and third, straight, shoots; 3 shoots after each row of knots; 15 knots per inch (60 per dm).  Brocading: 2 types of metal thread.  Both are silverstrip around a cream silk core but one appears to have been more tightly wrapped.  This may have been accidental as it changes in mid-motif and does not appear to have been a deliberate design ploy.  The brocading is over three warp threads and under one; on the return row it goes under the middle of the three in the previous row.\n\nPile:  wool and cotton; 15 colours: dark red, red, light red, orange, dark yellow, yellow, very dark green, dark green, green, light green, very light green, blue, light blue, black, white (cotton); assymetrical knot open to the left and tied around two threads; 255-292 knots per sq. inch (4080-4800 per sq. dm).\n\nSide finish:  one cord oversewn with red silk.  Green silk braid has been added later.\n\nEnd finish:  Lower: cut.  Upper: missing.",
