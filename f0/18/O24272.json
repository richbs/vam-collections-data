The robe is of plain weave (tabby) and has a staggered diamond design reserved in white on a blue ground. The design was produced by the resist stencil method called <i>aigata</i> in the Ryukyus. An identical design appears on the reverse of the cloth indicating that after the resist had been applied to the front, the back was brushed with water then scraped with a knife, drawing the paste through the cloth. The entire length of cloth would then have been brushed with dye on both sides.\nThe shoulder section is lined with soft white cotton with a formalised flower design in blue.",
