            "public_access_description": "Franz Anton Bustelli's models for the Nymphenburg porcelain factory are often regarded as some of the most delightful porcelain figures ever made.  Although only working at the factory for eight and a half years, Bustelli designed many different models, among them a group of sixteen Italian comedy figures, of which Octavio is one.  The group derives from well-known popular print sources, but just as Kaendler's style is recognisable in the figures he made at Meissen using the same prints, those made at Nymphenburg are unmistakably by the hand of Bustelli.  They are all slightly elongated, graceful, elegantly dressed and modelled with an almost lifelike sense of movement..  They are also extremely well-observed and relate to companion figures by virtue of their stance, expression and gestures.\n\nIn the Italian 'Commedia dell'arte' Octavio is the handsome lover of Isabella, however the subtle modelling also suggests he is a comically lovesick and foppish kind of young man.  His dress and hairstyle (or wig) are slightly out-of-date which was the norm for theatrical costume of the day, but may also be intended to suggest he is an impoverished nobleman.  His attention has been caught by the sight of his paramour Isabella and we see him turning to feast his eyes on her and blow her a kiss.",

Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art and Yale University Press, 2001. 89 p., no.136. ISBN 0300090099\n'He is richly dressed in an old-fashioned costume.  He wears a plain purple coat with a long brocaded waistcoat over his black breeches.  His impeccably groomed and powdered hair or wig is confined with a black silk ribbon and a pouch that conceals his ponytail, while a similar bow is tied around his neck.   This tie was called a solitaire and was the height of fashion in the 1730s and 1740s.  Octavio's costume would have been recognised as belonging to an earlier generation by Bustelli and his patrons, who by the 1750s chose to wear coats, breeches, and waistcoats of the same colour and fabric.  Two interesting conclusions may be reached: that the costume reflected Octavio's worthy but impoverished state; or, alternatively, that Bustelli knew that actors frequently wore out-of-date, secondhand clothes.'\nJansen, Reinhard, ed. <i><u>Commedia Dell'Arte, Fest der Kom\u00f6dianten, Keramische Kostbarkeiten aus den Museen der Welt</i></u> with essays by Ulrich Pietsch, Meredith Chilton, Reinhard Jansen, Samuel Wittwer etc. Catalogue of the exhibition held at Schloss Charlottenburg and the Br\u00f6han Museum, 2001, together with separate summary in English and booklet of source prints.
