Its format shows that it was designed to lie on a lectern (a reading desk) to be read. The illumination is of a high quality. It was probably the work of itinerant illuminators whose work can be found in manuscripts produced in other centres.\n\nWe do not know for certain where exactly the Glazier-Rylands Bible was made. Cambrai has been proposed, as well as Tournai and the county of Hainaut, France. One of the problems is that it is difficult to locate a notional workshop in a specific area, because at that time travelling artists were brought together for special commissions in different places. At least three illuminators who worked on the Bible moved on to Li\u00e8ge in the Southern Netherlands. There they contributed to a magnificent Psalter (a service book containing the Psalms), which we think introduced an up-to-date High Gothic style from France to that area.\n\nThis Bible is now scattered between several repositories. They include the Glazier Collection in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York and the John Rylands University Library in Manchester. The leaves from the Bible now in the V&A were acquired from the dealer and scholar W. H. James Weale in 1883. This leaf depicts Solomon addressing a group of Jews.",
