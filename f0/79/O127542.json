His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel\u2019s first work on Broadway was Peter Glenville\u2019s production of Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet at the Broadhurst Theatre, New York, 1951.   His costumes and sets were inspired by Italian Renaissance painting and were faithful to the conventions of an Elizabethan stage.   The New York critics found the designs colourful and atmospheric, but the direction received  mixed reviews.   The production ran for forty-nine performances.\n\nFresco paintings in Orvieto Cathedral by the Italian Renaissance artist Luca Signorelli (1450-1523) and engravings of frescoes by Benozzo Gozzoli (1420-1497) in Pisa\u2019s Camposanto inspired Messel\u2019s atmospheric recreation of medieval Verona.",
