The chair was designed and manufactured as an inexpensive dining chair for use in both domestic and commercial settings. The 'Rib' was part of a larger range, including office seating and bar stools.\n\nInfluences from the better-known design group Memphis can be seen in this piece with its echoes of simple, yet bold geometric shapes of Italian designs from the early 1980s. The design of the back has provided the inspiration for the name of the chair, suggesting the form of spine and ribs to give the chair an actual \u2018back\u2019.",

The self-consciously naive designs of the early 1980s Italian Memphi group, which used configurations of bold geometric shapes as components of furniture, can be compared to this design. The chair can also be seen as late example of the High-Tech style. Manufactured as an inexpensive dining chair for use in both the home and restaurants the 'Rib' was part of a larger range including office seating and bar stools. The name, derived from the form of the back, demonstrates the growing interest in anthropomorphic detailing which countered the sterility of much High-Tech furniture.",
