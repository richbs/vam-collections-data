She has exhibited in several exhibitions (both solo and in groups) in Korea and abroad including \"From the Fire: Contemprorary Korean Ceramics\", 2004-2007, in the U.S. \n\nThe work was made using slip casting technique. Liquid clay (called slip) is poured into a plaster mould, which has the negative shape of the desired Flat Jar. By capillary suction, the water from the slip is absorbed by the mould and a wall of clay forms against the inside of the mould.  The remaining slip is drained out of the mould and the cast of clay, when partially solidified, is then easily removed from the mould. \n\nThe piece was shown as part of the exhibition Tradition Transformed  (from 20 May to 3 October 2011 at the V&A). Tradition Transformed   showcases the work of contemporary Korean ceramic artists who combine traditional methods with modern ingenuity and innovative techniques.",
