One of Warington Taylor\u2019s letters shows that it was issued before <i>Indian</i> and <i>Queen Anne</i>. \n\nInitially produced in two colourways, yellow and olive, another seven were added in the 1870s. In most cases the printed colours were only slightly deeper than the ground. Morris disapproved of using more than one paper in a room but, if a second was required, he recommended using a pattern like this. A non-directional design, it was also suitable for use as a ceiling paper.'",
