London : South Kensington Museum, 1874.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'FLORETINE SCHOOL.\n\nMASO FINIGUERRA.\nGoldsmith, worker in niello, inventor of the process of taking off impressions on paper from engraved plates.\nBorn 1410, flourished in the middle of the 15th century.\n\nThere appears to be but one collection in Europe containing drawings ascribed to this master, that in the Ducal palace at Florence, which originally formed a portion of the collection of Cardinal Leopold of Tuscany. Baldinucci speaks very highly of this series of fifty-six works, and describes them as principally studies of single figures, designed with a pen on white paper, and slightly shaded with bistre or Indian ink, and as possessing, in an eminent degree, that correctness of outline and simplicity of manner which especially characterise the works of Masaccio. Baldinucci uses this language to favour his theory that Finiguerra was the last-named painter\u2019s scholar.\n\nVENUS, standing, partially draped, holding a bow in her right hand, and a vase in her left, from which water is flowing to Cupid, who is reclining on the ground ; on the other side, at the back of the Goddess, is a boy, with a caduceus ; above is inscribed, in a semicircle, VENERI VLCANI VXORI DICATVM.\nPen and bistre, highly finished. 148\n\n<i>Height</i>, 10 9/12 <i>inches.  Width,</i> 8 5/12 <i>inches.  With the corners cut off.</i> \n\nThe initials of the artist, I. F. T., are on a tablet beneath, transposed for engraving, and may be read thus, \u201cTommaso Finiguerra incidit.\u201d From the Collection of Richard Cosway, R.A., and probably the drawing described in the sale catalogue of his collection, No. 362, as by Andrea Mantegna.'\nWard-Jackson, Peter, <u>Italian Drawings. Volume I. 14th-16th century</u>, London, 1979, pp. 18-19 The following is the full text of the entry: <i>school of </i> MANTEGNA, ANDREA (1431-1506) 12 Venus, with a bow, pouring out a libation, accompanied by two cupids Inscribed at the top 'VENERI VLCANI UXOR I DlCATUl\\\\' Below, on a tablet, the initials '1FT.' Inscribed on the back of the mount in ink in an old hand 'G.91. del Mantegna' and in pencil in a modern hand '647' and 'RC' Pen and brown ink; the corners cut off II X 8 1/2 (280 x 215) Dyce 148 PROVENANCE R. Cosway (Lugt 629: possibly lot 362, described as by Mantegna, in the sale catalogue, 14-22 February 1822); Dyce Bequest 1869 LITERATURE <i>Dyce Catalogue</i> no. 148 (as by Maso Finiguerra); A. M. Hind, <i>Catalogue of early Italian engravings in the British Museum</i>, 1910, p. 358; Reitlinger, p. 7, no. 8 and pl, 3; A. M. Hind, <i>Early Italian Engraving</i>, 1948, part 2, 5, p. 26, no. 20; Popham and Pouncey, pp. 94 and 103 As Popham and Pouncey point out, the Venus is adapted from a figure of Diana in a drawing by Mantegna in the British Museum (no. 1861-8-10-2: Popham and Pouncey, no. 156 and pl. 148) They suggest that the initials IFT on our sheet are a later addition. The same initials, not necessarily an artist's signature, occur on an engraving by a follower of Mantegna showing Hercules and the Hydra (Bartsch, 13, p. 324, no. 12; Hind, <i>Early Italian Engraving</i>, 6, pl. 518). The engraver's drawing is in the British Museum (Popham and Pouncey, no. 163, pl. 150). Hind considered that technically our drawing is sufficiently near to the engraving to suggest an identity of hand. But these technical similarities are common to more than one artist who worked under the influence of Mantegna. Popham and Pouncey see no connection between our drawing and the engraver's design in the British Museum. The author of the <i>Dyce Catalogue</i> doubtless attributed the Dyce drawing to Maso Finiguerra because Mariette had suggested that the monogram IFT on the engraving might be read backwards as <i>Tommaso Finiguerra Ineidit</i> (Bottari, <i>Raccolta di lettere</i>, Milan, 2, 1822, p. 330). The drawing is a good deal rubbed and damaged all over, and a piece is torn away in the bottom left corner. See also the note on no. 14 below, a similar drawing, ascribed to Parentino.",
