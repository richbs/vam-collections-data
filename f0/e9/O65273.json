A constant supply of fashionable new designs from which to create new lines was required, so patternmakers and master weavers like James Leman supplied a wide range of designs for different weavers. The album contains some of his work from the period 1706-1716, as well as five designs from the 1730s, including this one which is from about 1736-1739.\n\nNatalie Rothstein stated in her catalogue Silk Designs of the Eighteenth Century that 'the startling effect produced by the use of much white for the highlights and the predominating purple colour of this full-blown design means that it resembles French designs of the late 1730s. Although this could be an English copy, a piece of woven silk with this exact pattern and of correspondingly fine quality is in the Mus\u00e9e Historique des Tissus, Lyon, and there is no reason to doubt that the silk is French, for there are other silks of the same class in the same French collection'.\n\nJames Leman was born in 1688 into a weaving family of Huguenot descent. In 1702 he was apprenticed to his father, Peter, and lived with his family in Stewart Street, Spitalfields in London.",

Natalie Rothstein catalogued the designs before the album was bought by the Victoria and Albert Museum. She gave each design a VS number (for Vanners Silks) in her catalogue <u>Silk Designs of the Eighteenth Century</u>. The designs have been subsequently numbered by the Prints, Drawings and Paintings Department, however, a concordance exists.\n\nHistorical significance: The designs collected in the album are, with the exception of some fragmentary medieval examples in Italian collections, the earliest silk designs known to exist.", 
            "place": "France", 
            "production_note": "The following information is taken from Natalie Rothstein, <u>Silk Designs of the Eighteenth Century</u>. Please see the bibliographic reference under 'References' for more details.\n\n'The startling effect produced by the use of much white for the highlights and the predominating purple colour of this full-blown design mean that it resembles French designs of the late 1730s. Although this could be an English copy, a piece of woven silk with this exact pattern and of correspondingly fine quality is in the Mus\u00e9e Historique des Tissus, Lyon, and there is no reason to doubt that the silk is French, for there are other silks of the same class in the same French collection. There is also a design at Lyon for a silk in this style that is apparently signed by the great Lyonnais silk-designer Revel himself and there are similar designs in Paris.'\n\nRothstein also stated that this drawing is one of five (E.1861.2-1991 (VS.1), E.1861.55-1991 (VS.97), E.1861.85-1991 (VS.76), E.1861.101-1991 (VS.92), E.1861.105-1991 (VS.96)) 'which fall outside the main body of the Vanners Silks Set. They are all of much later date. This can be seen by comparing them with dated designs in the [Anna Maria] Garthwaite Set [in the Prints, Drawings and Paintings Department at the V&amp;A] and with dated French designs in Paris and Lyon. The choice of motifs, the much greater degree of naturalism and the use in all but VS.76 [E.1861.85-1991] of <i>points rentr\u00e9s</i>indicate for all of them a date in the 1730s.\n\nIt is conceivable that some of these drawings are by James Leman who was still alive in the 1730s. The short English inscription on VS.76 [E.1861.85-1991] may be in his hand and the inscription itself, together with the fact that three of the drawings have been squared off for drafting, does seem to indicate that these patterns were woven in England.\n\nBut the superb design VS.96 [E.1861.105-1991] and to a lesser extent VS.96 [E.1861.85-1991] and VS.92 [E.1861.101-1991], so resemble French designs of the period that they must either be actual French drawings or close copies of them. There can be no doubt that VS.96 [E.1861.105-1991] is French and possibly by Jean Revel himself. It would have been perfectly in accordance with the practice at Spitalfields for Leman to have been in possession of French designs for woven silks: among the group of designs belonging to Garthwaite is a whole series labelled 'French Patterns'. The present five designs [E.1861.2-1991 (VS.1), E.1861.55-1991 (VS.97), E.1861.85-1991 (VS.76), E.1861.101-1991 (VS.92), E.1861.105-1991 (VS.96)] may represent some of Leman's 'French Patterns'.'",
