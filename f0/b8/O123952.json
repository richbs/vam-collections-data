It was itself shown at the Paris 1863 Union Centrale Exposition. Originally known as 'L'Amour et L'Amitie' (Love and Friendship), it later became known as L'Amour se Confie a l'Amitie' (Love Confiding in Friendship). It typifies the adaptations of styles and themes of a century earlier popular during the 1860s. Many of Carrier-Belleuse's salon works were commercially reproduced by either his own studio or by companies such as Deniere, as is the case with this bronze.",

His interest in industrial techniques and the decorative arts is seen in designs for goldsmiths and in a book of drawings, <i>The Application of the human figure to industrial decoration and ornamentation</i> (1884). He was involved with architectural sculpture to decorate Paris as rebuilt to Haussmann's plans.",
