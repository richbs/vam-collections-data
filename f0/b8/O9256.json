            "public_access_description": "This jug is of the type known as 'Mill Green Ware'. Mill Green, near Ingatestone in Essex, was a pottery production centre that supplied consumer needs in London and throughout Kent and Essex. Their products have also been found in smaller numbers in Hertfordshire and in Cambridgeshire. Excavations of the kilns used at Mill Green have indicated that it was producing pottery between about 1270 and 1350.\n\nMill Green jugs are characterised by their white slip coating and speckled green glazing. These jugs are thinly potted, indicating fine craftsmanship. This feature combined with the decorative incised slip and coloured glaze indicates that the jugs were intended for use in fine dining settings.\n\nThe larger portion of the body of this jug is covered with a slip of white clay.  This was used to enhance its decorative effect. The red body of the jug was covered with the contrasting white colour slip and then lines were incised through the slip, revealing the red body underneath. This was a simple means of achieving more than one colour on the body of the pot. \n\nAdditionally, the centre portion of the jug was then given a sprinkling of a coloured glaze. Glaze, produced in this instance from lead sulphide (\u2018galena\u2019), was not used in the south east of England until the latter part of the 11th century. Glazing renders the ceramic body less permeable to liquids. On this jug it is only sparsely used and is intended primarily for decorative effect. The green colour is achieved by adding copper filings to the galena in suspension. \n\nThe base of the jug is slightly convex and has depressions all round on the exterior of the rim. This is known as \u2018thumbing\u2019 and was formerly believed to have been done to render the convex base more stable when placed on a flat surface. Recent experiments have indicated that the \u2018thumbing\u2019 and convex bases enabled the unfired, glazed, pots to stack better upside down and to reduce the contact surface between the stacked pots. If any glaze fell from one pot down to another in the kiln and fused them together, the point of this fused contact was minimal and could be severed safely.\n\nThis type of jug was formerly known as 'West Kent ware'. Similar jugs can be found in the British Museum and in the Museum of London.",

            "historical_context_note": "This jug is of the type known as 'Mill Green Ware'. Mill Green, near Ingatestone in Essex, was a pottery production centre that supplied consumer needs in London and throughout Kent and Essex. Their products have also been found in smaller numbers in Hertfordshire and in Cambridgeshire. Excavations of the kilns used at Mill Green have indicated that it was producing pottery between about 1270 and 1350.\n\nMill Green jugs are characterised by their white slip coating and speckled green glazing. These jugs are thinly potted, indicating fine craftsmanship. This feature combined with the decorative incised slip and coloured glaze indicates that the jugs were intended for use in fine dining settings.\n\nThe larger portion of the body of this jug is covered with a slip of white clay.  This was used to enhance its decorative effect. The red body of the jug was covered with the contrasting white colour slip and then lines were incised through the slip, revealing the red body underneath. This was a simple means of achieving more than one colour on the body of the pot. \n\nAdditionally, the centre portion of the jug was then given a sprinkling of a coloured glaze. Glaze, produced in this instance from lead sulphide (\u2018galena\u2019), was not used in the south east of England until the latter part of the 11th century. Glazing renders the ceramic body less permeable to liquids. On this jug it is only sparsely used and is intended primarily for decorative effect. The green colour is achieved by adding copper filings to the galena in suspension. \n\nThe base of the jug is slightly convex and has depressions all round on the exterior of the rim. This is known as \u2018thumbing\u2019 and was formerly believed to have been done to render the convex base more stable when placed on a flat surface. Recent experiments have indicated that the \u2018thumbing\u2019 and conves bases enabled the unfired, glazed, pots to stack better upside down and to reduce the contact surface between the stacked pots. If any glaze fell from one pot down to another in the kiln and fused them together, the point of this fused contact was minimal and could be severed safely.\n\nThis type of jug was formerly known as 'West Kent ware'. Similar jugs can be found in the British Museum and in the Museum of London.",
