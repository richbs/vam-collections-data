A donkey cropping the hedge in a similar attitude is to be seen in the 'Dedham Vale' of 1811 (collection of Sir Richard Proby). Holmes, in the <u>Burlington Magazine</u>, Vol. XII, 1907-8, p. 76, discussed whether No. 287 could be a sketch of 1811 for the earlier picture, which was then used again for 'The Cornfield'. He concluded that the sketch must be of the later date on grounds of style: this conclusion is fortified by the fact, which Holmes does not seem to have noticed, that the foal of the donkey is to be seen in No. 287, as in the picture 'The Cornfield'. This second donkey, which is head on to the spectator, is difficult to discern, and the subject of the sketch has hitherto been described in the Museum's catalogues as a single donkey browsing. There is a thumbnail sketch of a donkey, in a somewhat similar attitude to that of the mother, in the sketch-book No. 121, p. 32; and at all periods Constable was fond of introducing donkeys into his paintings. In his letter of 3 December 1815 to Maria Bicknell he writes: \"Yesterday was so very mild that I went painting in the feild from a donkey that I wanted to introduce in a little picture\" (<u>Beckett</u>, II, p. 162). Since the first version of 'The Cottage in a Cornfield' was ready for exhibition in 1817, and the drawing for it (No. 145) was made <i>c</i>.1815, this sentence might refer to that composition (see No. 352)\n\n\nGraham Reynolds\"",

A donkey cropping the hedge in a similar attitude is to be seen in the 'Dedham Vale' of 1811 (collection of Sir Richard Proby). Holmes, in the <u>Burlington Magazine</u>, Vol. XII, 1907-8, p. 76, discussed whether No. 287 [Museum No. 790-1888] could be a sketch of 1811 for the earlier picture, which was then used again for 'The Cornfield'. He concluded that the sketch must be of the later date on grounds of style: this conclusion is fortified by the fact, which Holmes does not seem to have noticed, that the foal of the donkey is to be seen in No. 287 [Museum No. 790-1888], as in the picture 'The Cornfield'. This second donkey, which is head on to the spectator, is difficult to discern, and the subject of the sketch has hitherto been described in the Museum's catalogues as a single donkey browsing. There is a thumbnail sketch of a donkey, in a somewhat similar attitude to that of the mother, in the sketch-book No. 121, p. 32; [Museum No. 317-1888] and at all periods Constable was fond of introducing donkeys into his paintings. In his letter of 3 December 1815 to Maria Bicknell he writes: \"Yesterday was so very mild that I went painting in the feild from a donkey that I wanted to introduce in a little picture\" (<u>Beckett</u>, II, p. 162). Since the first version of 'The Cottage in a Cornfield' was ready for exhibition in 1817, and the drawing for it (No. 145 [Museum No. 828-1888]) was made <i>c</i>.1815, this sentence might refer to that composition (see No. 352 [Museum No. 1631-1888].",
