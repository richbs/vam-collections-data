Its stand was probably made between 1850 and 1900 to make it more appealing to antique collectors.  The carcase is in oak and the sides and doors have been decorated with flat, applied sections of oak forming round-headed arches.  The centres of these and other areas of the cabinet have been further embellished with turned motifs that have been cut down the middle, stained dark to give the appearance of ebony, before being glued and pinned to the cupboard. Although the stand was probably made up in the 19th century, the two drawers seem to be of a similar date to the cupboard.  The drawers are simply nailed together, showing the workshop practice of joiners before the sophisticated technique of dovetail jointing became common in England in the second half of the 17th century - marking the point when the specialist trade of cabinet-making developed.\n\nOn loan to Provost Skeen's House.",
