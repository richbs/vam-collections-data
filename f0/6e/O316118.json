Jessie Newbery's revolutionary teaching emphasised the importance of form and structure over superficial decoration and encouraged simple, speedy techniques. She taught a wide range of students and Saturday morning classes were organised for primary and secondary teachers and professionals.\n\nJessie Newbery's individual use of coarse fabrics, pastel colours and plain stitching greatly influenced modern embroidery and the teaching of embroidery to children at the time.These ideas were continued in the work of her pupil Ann Macbeth(1875-1945), who began teaching at the school in 1901 and took over the class following Mrs Newbery's retirement in 1908.  \n\nAnother version of this embroidered sideboard cloth, by 'Miss Runciman' was illustrated in The Studio (Volume 50, Issue 208, July 1910, page 129). The design may have been produced by Ann Macbeth, or another teacher at the school, Margaret Swanson, as a project for students.\n\nThe donor of the cloth, Annie Templeton Anderson, remembered that Frances Mary Templeton, her aunt, attended classes given by Ann Macbeth in Helensburgh (letter to Peter Floud, dated 23rd September 1952). Frances Mary Templeton also embroidered T.38-1953, a panel of Leek Embroidery.",

One of ten children who lived in Helensburgh, the embroiderer's sister married  a silk-throwster (this involves the finishing of raw silk to various thicknesses,qualities and strengths) called Anderson. in 1876 he took over a Goven firm which had been in Glasgow since 1824 (it also had factories in Motherwell, Lanarkshire and at Glemsford in Suffolk). Anderson and Thomas Wardle became friends and it was Anderson &amp; Robertson silk which was used by Thomas Wardle for his printed silks. The Museum also has a panel of Leek embroidery by Frances Mary Templeton.\n\nThis runner was exhibited at the V&amp;A Exhibition of Victorian and Edwardian Decorative Arts, 1952 (cat.R.34).",
