            "public_access_description": "Joseph-Th\u00e9odore Deck (1823-1891), born in Guebwiller, Alsace, was apprenticed to a traditional stove-making firm in Strasbourg, learning his trade there and then in other centres in Germany and Austria. He moved to Paris in about 1851 as overseer for the Dumas stove and tile firm (which made this panel as a 'blank'), and in 1855 opened his own studio and, later his own retail shop, with his brother Xavier. He invited many well-known painters of the day to design decorations and also to paint some wares directly. This panel by Joseph-Victor Ranvier (1832-1896)  is such an example.  Deck specialised in researching glazes and colours, inspired by the ceramics of the Middle and Far East. In 1887, only three years before his death, he became Director of the National Manufactory at S\u00e8vres.",
