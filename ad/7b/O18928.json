In the upper left corner is a female figure representing Knowledge: she is dressed in violet and pink robes with a laurel wreath on her head, and holds an open book and a sphere, and is being approached by a young girl with long chestnut hair and white and brown robes of medieval style.  In the upper right corner is a female figure representing Truth: she is dressed in red and green robes and holds a large circular mirror and a lamp, and is being approached by a young boy with chestnut hair and white robes resembling those of a monk.  The inscription is contained within a rectangular white cartouche printed in black with an initial and decorative roundel in colour.",
