The art developed at Fontainebleau includes all sorts of media such as fresco paintings, sculpture and more traditional easel paintings. The development of printmaking also contributed to disseminate this style that was then applied to a wide range of works, from architecture to jewellery.",

Popham to his assistant in Fontainebleau L\u00e9onard Thiry (act. 1536-1550). \n\nIt shows a mythological scene of sacrifice, this subject drawn from the pagan world and the mythology is typical of the imagery developed by the School of Fontainebleau, France, during the 16th century by a group of Italian mannerist artists including Rosso Fiorentino, Niccolo dell\u2019Abate and Francesco Primaticcio. Although very close in style to Primaticcio\u2019s drawings after the Antique, the drawing was probably not made by the master but is probably the work of a close follower. \n\nD. Cordellier associates this drawing with a group of drawings showing motifs from the Antique, respectively ascribed to Fantuzzi, Davent, Rosso and Primaticcio (Cordellier, 2004). None of these drawings can be firmly attributed though. \n\nAccording to Zerner, a very close engraving of similar dimensions (and in the same direction) is the work of L\u00e9on Davent c. 1546, after an original work by Primaticcio (Bartsh, 33, p. 205 and Zerner, LD 61). The original work however has never been found. Davent\u2019s work is difficult to identify as only one of his engravings, <i>The Apostles Contemplating Christ and the Virgin</i> (1546; Zerner, L.D. 55) after Giulio Romano, bears a full name, \u2018Lion Daven\u2019. All the others have merely the monogram \u2018L.D.\u2019, under which his work is usually catalogued.\n\nDavent reproduced principally the works of Francesco Primaticcio, and is considered by some as the finest engraver of the school of Fontainebleau. Very little is known about his life and career, and he is sometimes confused with the Flemish engraver L\u00e9onard Thiry also active in Fontainebleau at the same time. Davent made engravings from 1540, turning to etching c. 1543\u20134. Herbet attributed 221 plates to him, Zerner only 98.",
