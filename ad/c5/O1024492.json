The text is as follows: Three fragments of drawings mounted together on one sheet, each enclosed in a border of arabesques in gold The upper drawing in pen and ink, the lower two in pen and ink and wash Size of sheet 17 5/8 x 8 \u00bd (448 x 216) 4899 PROVENANCE Sir P. Lely (Lugt 2092); J. Talman (as indicated by the ornamental gold borders; see Lugt 2462); Rev Dr H. Wellesley (sale, Sotheby, 25 June to 10 July 1866, unidentified lot, bought for the Museum) The old attribution to Perino is convincing. The subjects of the three separate sheets are as follows: (a) small triangular fragment showing the base of a candelabrum (b) rectangular sheet, composed of two separate sheets pasted together, showing designs for a vase and two candelabra; on the back a sketch of a seated figure, a putto hiding behind a large mask, the lower half of a sketch of three putti dancing and of a sketch of a goat (c) smaller rectangular sheet, composed of two sheets pasted together, showing the base of a candelabrum decorated with a mask, a reclining faun and two dolphins. This drawing is perhaps by a different hand.",
