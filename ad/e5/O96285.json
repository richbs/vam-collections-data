On the other side the semi-circular central field is made up of foliate shoots, inlaid with gold foil, emanating from a flower of green and red glass inlay and terminating in two roundels of red glass and inlaid gold foil. Three semicircular inlays at the junctions of teh shoots are made of blue glass.",

This combing symbolically ordered his mind, as well as reducing the risk of falling hair contaminating the wine. The image on the comb represents Sagittarius shooting at Capricorn. Carolingian scholars were particularly interested in astrology. Combs played a major role in the coronation ceremonies of kings and emperors from the early middle Ages through to the modern era.",
