Tourists loved to buy coral jewellery in fashionable shapes, but it was also very popular with Italian women, who valued it for its colour and amuletic qualities.  They believed that red was the most effective colour.  Coral branches were often left in a natural state for amulets, but beads for necklaces were always shaped in the 19th century.  \n\nThis necklace comes from Genoa, in the north of Italy, where the use of coral for protective reasons was not as universal as in the south.  The addition of white coral beads suggests that the main purpose of the necklace was decorative.  The pendant dagger may be purely decorative as well, although hair pins with heads shaped like daggers and swords were an essential part of the marriage ceremony in many places in northern Italy.  \n\nThis necklace was bought for \u00a31 8s as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
