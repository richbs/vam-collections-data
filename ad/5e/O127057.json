            "public_access_description": "The exact purpose and original location of this relief is uncertain. It may have formed some part of an interior decoration of a house, possibly that of a doorway or a large chimneypiece. This would tie in with the architectural theme depicted. Alternatively, it could have been a section of a monument. It was said to have come from Carlton House, London. This supposition was based on the recollections of a mason who claimed to have seen the relief in situ. However, this idea has since been discredited as the mason arrived in London some 90 years after the house was demolished. It may however have formed part of a chimneypiece executed by Rysbrack between 1733 and 1736 for John, 4th Duke of Bedford, which was installed in the Great Saloon or Ballroom at Bedford House, London. This chimneypiece is known to have been dismantled in 1800.\n\nWhatever its original location, its style can certainly be associated with John Michael Rysbrack who was active in England in the second quarter of the 18th century. The Museum also possesses two related terracotta sketch models (7717-1863 and 7718-1863). These show only slight differences between the original designs in terracotta and the final marble.\n\nRysbrack (1694-1770) was born in Antwerp, and trained in the Netherlands, but spent his working life in Britain. He was one of the most important sculptors active in this country in the first half of the 18th century, and specialised in portrait busts and funerary monuments. Although he never visited Italy, many of his works are clearly indebted to classical archetypes. His terracotta models are particularly fine, and are often virtually finished pieces in their own right.",
