Their son Laurence also became a miniature painter, and it was probably Laurence who added the untypical encircling inscription and coats of arms as a memorial to his parents. This miniature was painted during the Hilliards' three-year stay in France, 1576-1578. Hilliard was probably influenced there by the famous chalk drawings of Fran\u00e7ois Clouet, noted for their seductive ability to catch fleeting expression. On his return to England, Hilliard's portraiture, even of men, was to be characterised by a similarly sensitive quality, of which this work is typical.",

Full Citation:\n\n\u201cNICHOLAS HILLIARD\n\n<b>77 Alice Brandon, Mrs Hilliard</b>, 1578\n\n<i>Victoria & Albert Museum (P.2-1942)</i>\nVellum stuck to card and subsequently stuck to a larger, circular piece of card upon which the outer band of inscription and decoration has been painted, almost circular, 59 x 57.5 mm, 2 5/16 x 2 14 in.\n\nAlice Brandon (b. 1556-d. before 1608, daughter of Robert Brandon, the Queen\u2019s goldsmith, married Nicholas Hilliard in 1675 and bore him seven children, Daniel, Elizabeth, Francis, Laurence, Lettice, Penelope and Robert.\n\nThis delightful miniature was definitely painted while Hilliard was in France and is recognized as the prime instance of a more direct contact with the portraiture of Francois Clouet.  Its sensitivity and feminine charm reflects very full the impact of French portraiture which, particularly in the chalk drawings, aimed at catching fleeting expression.\n\nThe face has been damaged, with restoration to the forehead.  There is a degree of flaking and the usual fading and oxidizing of the silver.  This retains a frame of a type which at one time was also added to both the miniature of Nicholas and Richard Hilliard (nos. 48, 49).  It would seem highly likely that this decorative border was added by Laurence Hilliard.  The inscription refers to Alice as <i>UXOR PRIMA</i>, Hilliard\u2019s first wife which would indicate that the Nicholas who married Susan Gysard in 1608 was the miniaturist (Edmond <i>Limners and Picture-makers</i>, p. 68).\n\nThis is a rare instance of Hilliard signing with a monogram NH.\n\nINSCRIBED: Above the shoulders: <i>NH</i> (in monogram); on either side of the head: <i>Ano Dni / * AEsS. 22.</i>\nOn the mount over the arms left of Hilliard and right of Brandon and the inscription: <i>+ ALICIA . BRANDON NICOLAI HILLYARD . Q / VI PROPRIA MANV DEPINXIT VXOR PRIMA.</i>\n\nCOLLECTIONS: The miniature is not referred to in Laurence Hilliard\u2019s will as are those of her husband and father-in-law (see no. 48) which supposes a different descent; it was purchased together with another Hilliard by Walter Francis, 5th Duke of Buccleuch, in 1869; thence by descent; acquired through the N.A.C.F., 1942.\n\nLITERATURE: C.
