The decorative band (50mm wide) consists of three figures in a row The first is a man (?) in a short tunic (with what could be leopard spots on it). S/he has blue/green and red stripes at the front of their legs. This may indicate boots. The second figure is a woman wearing a long robe.  She has some red detail in her hair parting and a bracket with a red centre. The third is a man, with a beard, in a short tunic.  The figures are in purple with undyed thread forming the details. They sit within a single lined border on either side. The linen on which the figures were woven was very fine although most has been lost. The band is attached to a coarser linen cloth at 17x22 tpc  (sys 1 x sys 2). This thread width differs in some places. Two thick rows run alongside the right side of the band, created by weaving 4 or 5 linen threads together at that point.  Half way along these lines are plaited together. The plaiting ends after 140mm and the threads separate again. The piece is stained. See 1025-1901 and 1026-1901",
