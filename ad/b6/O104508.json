He entered his first mark in 1776, the year these candlesticks were made but earlier also supplied his products to the celebrated workshop of  John Parker and Edward Wakelin.\n\nThe candlesticks show also  that although the silver trade was threatened by the manufacturers of cheaper substitutes, it also benefitted from their technologies. Before the late 18th century the decoration on these candlesticks would have been either chased on (pressed into shape using a fine tool called a burin) which was time consuming, or cast in a thickier gauge of silver, which was expensive. Here the candlesticks have been made using technology developed by the makers of Sheffield Plate and the sides of the candlesticks and the panels of the base have been stamped in the same shaped die four times and then soldered together. The technology was expensive, but once installed could rapidly increase productivity.",

He entered his first mark in 1776, the year these candlesticks were made but earlier also supplied his products to the celebrated workshop of  John Parker and Edward Wakelin.\n\nHistorical significance: The candlesticks were made at an interesting turning point in the history of the metal trades in Britain. The Sheffield Assay Ofiice had only opened in 1773, three years earlier than these sticks were produced. The establishment of the Sheffield and Birmingham offices reflected a dispersing of the trade away from London as well as an acknowledgement that cheaper plated wares were cutting into the silver market. No longer would Sheffield silver have to be sent to London or Chester for testing and the subsequent reduction in cost could be passed to the customer.\n\nThese sticks show how silversmiths adopted technology developed by the makers of Sheffield Plate, a cheaper subsititute of silver-plated copper. Rather than being laboriously chased by hand or expensively cast in silver, the sides of the candlesticks and panels of the base have been stamped in the same shaped die four times and then soldered together. The technology was costly, but once installed could rapidly increase productivity.",
