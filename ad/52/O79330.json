The beads on the five rows consist of plain hollow spherical beads alternating with pairs of knobbly beads made from pyramids of granules soldered together.  The spacer and terminals are made of plain sheet silver with filigree patterns applied on the front.  The central spacer also has three turquoise-coloured pastes set on its front.  There is a tiny open filigree pendant, shaped like a cylindrical amulet case, hanging from the lower edge of the central spacer, with five loops on its sides and lower edge from which hang pendants of S-shaped links with filigree discs and balls.   There are ten hollow drop-shaped pendants, each ending in a loose ball, hanging from the lowest row of the necklace, five on each side of the central pendant.  The necklace is strung on five strands of natural cotton, which are tied and cut off as they emerge from the terminals.",

They were particularly renowned for the quality of their filigree work, which was worn and appreciated as much by Muslim as by Jewish women.\n\nThis type of necklace, called a lazem, is one of the traditional styles made by the Jewish goldsmiths.  Its main distinguishing feature was a pendent cylindrical amulet case, but this has been reduced to barely more than a decorative element in this piece.  The silver beads are also typical of Yemeni jewellery.  Plain hollow beads are found in several countries, but the little knobbly beads, made from granules soldered together in pyramids, are one of the most characteristic elements of Yemeni jewellery, and are not found anywhere else.",
