It is a very rare example of furniture actually designed by the architect Sir William Chambers (1723-1796) for his own use.\n\nPeople\nChambers once described himself as 'a very pretty connoisseur in furniture'. His table was made by the Swedish cabinet-maker Georg Haupt (1741-1784) when he was in London. After spending five years in Paris and London, Haupt returned to Stockholm in 1769 to become cabinet-maker to the Swedish royal family.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe table is made of oak, veneered with satinwood, ebony and other woods, with specimen marbles set in the top.\n\nTime\nThe use of marble specimens set in tables was considered very fashionable during the 1760s and 1770s, and interest in Classical archaeology was widespread. An important contribution was Chambers's own Treatise on Civil Architecture, published in 1759, which helped establish him as one of the leading Neo-classical architects of his day. Chambers had studied extensively in Paris between 1749 and 1750, and in Rome between 1750 and 1755. The shape of the legs was probably inspired by Greek urns.",
