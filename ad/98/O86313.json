He was billed as \u2018America\u2019s Greatest Whistling Comedian\u2019 and was on the bill with Sam Mayo, whom Cooke also drew that week. This is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nTaft made his name as a whistler, and inscribed this caricature \u2018Yours whistling, Harry Taft\u2019. There were several other whistlers on the variety stage at the time, including Arthur Slater, \u2018The Whistling Man in White\u2019, and Tom Murray, \u2018The Champion Whistler\u2019. Harry Taft whistled solo, and to piano accompaniment. In 1899 his \u2018Listen To The Mocking Bird\u2019 was recorded by Emile Berliner, the American who developed the gramophone. In April 1906 The Performer magazine recorded \u2018Mr Harry Taft, the well-know whistler\u2019 sailing to America. Taft shared the bill with Little Tich on an Australian tour in 1905. He was then billed as a comedian, as he was by George Cooke in his list of subjects.",
