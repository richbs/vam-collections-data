The photograph is thus a record of the work done, probably taken between 1865-1880, and comes from an archive of designs and photographs from the firm. \n\nThere are printed designs for railings in a pattern book lettered 'Skidmore's Art Manufactures Co. Book of Designs' in Coventry Public Library. Some printed designs for railings in a private collection which are from a later date than the ones in Coventry because they are lettered 'BIRMINGHAM' as below. In 1872 Skidmore's Art Manufactures and Constructive Ironwork Company went into liquidation and was taken over by Winfields of Birmingham so it appears that Skidmore was still producing similar railings for more than seven years from 1865 because the pattern book in Coventry Library is lettered with the title that Skidmore's firm used from this earlier date. The page of designs in the private collection is lettered 'EXTERIOR RAILING, and GATES. balconies & c.'  and 'F:A:SKIDMORE: COVENTRY and 24 HUNTERS Rd BIRMINGHAM.'   Skidmore made railings for important commissions such as the Albert Memorial, Hyde Park, London and those in St. Mary's Guildhall, Coventry .",
