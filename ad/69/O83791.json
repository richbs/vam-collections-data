In the mid-19th century the Prince of Wales asked Poole to create a black version of the lounge coat, which he wore for informal men-only dinner parties at Sandringham. A guest at one of these parties took the new and comfortable evening suit home to Tuxedo Park in New York, and gave rise to the dinner suit's American name, the 'tuxedo'.",
