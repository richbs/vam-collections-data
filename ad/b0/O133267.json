            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, pp. 226-27\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"PHILLIPS, Henry Wyndham (1820-1868) \nBorn (presumably in London) 1820, younger son and pupil of the portrait painter Thomas Phillips RA (1770-1845). Exhibited 76 works, almost all portraits and several of eminent people, at the RA between 1838 and 1868, and 13 of various subjects at the BI 1848-67. Captain in the Artists' Volunteer Corps, and Secretary of the Artists' Benevolent Institution which his father principally founded. Died Sydenham, Kent (now London), 8 (5 according to the Art Journal and Rees) December 1868. \nLIT: \tThe Times 10 December 1868; Athenaeum 12 December 1868, p802; Art Journal 1869, p29; T M Rees Welsh Painters ... 1912, pp119-20 \n\n<b>The Royal Commissioners for the Exhibition of 1851</b> \nP112-1920 Neg 49160 \nCanvas, 209.6 X 358.6 cm (82 \u00bd X 141 ins) \nGiven by the Royal Commissioners 1920 (but see Prov: below) \nThe Royal Commission for the Great Exhibition was established after much debate on 3 January 1850; the Prince Consort was Chairman, the Commissioners were eminent men from Government, the arts, and industry. The Prince publicly announced the project at the Mansion House 21 March 1850, and the Exhibition opened 1 May 1851 (see the painting by H C Selous, 329-1889 p257). \nFrom left to right, the figures are: (standing, all statesmen unless otherwise indicated) Charles Wentworth Dilke, John Scott Russell (civil engineer), Henry Cole (first Director of the South Kensington Museum), Charles Fox, Joseph Paxton (architect), Lord John Russell, Sir Robert Peel, Robert Stephenson (civil engineer), and (seated) Richard Cobden, Charles Barry (architect), 2nd Earl Granville, William Cubitt (civil engineer), Albert the Prince Consort, and the 14th Earl of Derby. Paxton, the architect of the Crystal Palace, has presented his plans to the Prince Consort. \nIt seems certain the event depicted did not in fact occur, and was probably painted some time after Paxton presented his plans to the Prince. The figures depicted do not exactly correspond with the composition of any of the committees formed to organise the Great Exhibition. Sir Henry Co le recorded in his diary 21 June 1850 that at 'Palace Yard Paxton D[uke] of Devonshire's] gardener came with his plans which he said wd cost only \u00a380,000 for the hire'. On the same day, the Royal Commission held its eighteenth meeting under the chairmanship of Prince Albert at the new Palace of Westminster. Further meetings were held on 27 and 29 June, which was the last to be attended by Peel, who died 2 July. Any meeting involving the Prince, Peel and Paxton must have taken place between 21 and 29 June; the present work presumably aims to invent an amplified reconstruction of the presentation on the former date. \nThe prototype for Phillips for this kind of group portrait was presumably the 17th-century Dutch school, notably the work of Frans Hals. The way in which the figure of Lord John Russell disrupts the flow towards and around the Prince suggests his presence was added at a late stage of the composition; alternatively, it may be an attempt to emphasize his status as Prime Minister at the Prince's right hand. Comparable contemporary group portraits are John Hollins's 'A Consultation Previous to the Aerial Voyage to Weilburg, 1836', Sir John Gilbert's 'The Coalition Ministry, 1854' and the ambitious 'The Fine Arts Commissioners, 1846', by John Partridge (all NPG). \nThe fact that the artist's widow lent the painting to the International Exhibition of 1871 implies that the work was not painted to commission (or that the picture was not accepted) and indeed had not been sold; however, it seems an unusually ambitious work to be produced without a commission. \nPROV: The artist's wife by 1871 (see Exh: below); apparently lent by the artist's executors to the museum 1869, and given by the Royal Commissioners 1920 \nEXH: \tInternational Exhibition 1871 (231, as 'The Prince Consort in Council over Mr (afterwards Sir) Joseph Paxton's plans for the Exhibition of 1851', lent by Mrs H W Phillips) \nLIT: \tE Bonython King Cole nd [1982], p37, repr, p129 \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
