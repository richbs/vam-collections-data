Chains like this were worn hanging from the belt, to support keys and vinaigrettes, and under the chin, as well as round the neck and waist.  The stylised birds probably represent cockerels, an ancient sign of fertility through much of Europe.\n\nSardinian traditional jewellery is quite different from the traditional jewellery worn elsewhere in Italy.  It is mostly made of heavy silver, rather than gold, and often looks like medieval work from northern Europe.  This chain was described as Scandinavian when it was given to the V&A in 1937.  Although it is now unique to Sardinia, silver jewellery of this kind was probably worn more widely in southern Italy before the 19th century.  There are traces of an earlier tradition of heavy cast silver jewellery in places like Scanno, in Abruzzi.",
