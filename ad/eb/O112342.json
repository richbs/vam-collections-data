She first visited the monastery on Mount Carmel in Haifa, Israel, where the Carmelite order was founded in 1200. Originally allowed only to photograph the nuns in the garden, she gradually gained their trust, becoming, as they joked, the first Jewish woman to sleep there. \n\nFrom Mount Carmel Almog journeyed to the Carmelite monastery in Bethlehem, Palestine, where she became concerned with investigating the nuns\u2019 relationship to their confined surroundings. This photograph of the dining room there has a stillness that conveys something of the atmosphere of the monasteries \u2013 \u2018bubbles in the middle of estranged, non-religious neighbourhoods\u2019 as Almog says. \n\nThe series is an excellent example of an extended documentary project. The photographer\u2019s deep engagement with her subjects \u2013 in part an investigation by a Jewish woman into Christian women\u2019s beliefs \u2013 creates images of startling intimacy.",
