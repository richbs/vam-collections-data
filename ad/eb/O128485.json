This collection was put together in Vienna between 1869 and 1927 and was one of the largest and most important private collections of its time. It was sold in Berlin in 1930 and this tablet was bought as Lot 529 for 500 marks by Dr Walter Leo Hildburgh. Hildburgh gave the tablet to the Museum inn 1952 (R.F. 52/4221)\n\nWalter Leo Hildburgh was one of the V&A's most dedicated and generous patrons. Born in New York in 1876, he trained as a scientist. Initially he collected ethnography but after 1914 he turned to the decorative arts. Encouraged by successive Keepers of Metalwork, he accumulated huge collections of Spanish and German metalwork. From 1924 when he first offered objects to the Museum on loan, to 1956 when he bequeathed his huge collection, Hildburgh was  part of the Museum landscape. He regularly gave the Museum presents at Christmas and on his birthday. His will set up a fund for future purchases, administered in the spirit of his earlier acquisitions.\n\nHistorical significance: Memorial brasses are important sources of information about clothing, armour, status and social aspirations as they are often accompanied by inscriptions and are one of the few examples of medieval art that is consistently dated. German merchant tablets are relatively rare as such commemorative gestures tended to be confined to the aristocracy.",

They were fitted onto the lids of tombs and memorial slabs, or mounted on walls to commemorate the lives of the deceased. Memorials in brass or latten (copper alloy), and occasionally bronze, as with this example, gradually superseded stone examples.\n\nThis tablet depicts a merchant's mark on a shield, probably the trademark of Konrat Mackel who is commemorated in the shield. Mackel must have been a wealthy merchant: commemorative tablets in Germany tended to be the preserve more of the aristocracy.\n\nMerchants used 'marks' from around the thirteenth century and continued to use them for the next four or five hundred years.
