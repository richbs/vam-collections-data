In the 1880s, typewriters were just coming into use in offices in England, but at home ink and fountain pens remained  the most important elements of writing equipment for many years. This inkstand has two ink pots to hold the ink and a tray for pens at the front. The sentimental subject of  a figure of cupid presenting a letter and the highly decorative taste of the inkstand may indicate that it was made to appeal to a female consumer.\n\nTime\nThe inkstand is of highly ornate Rococo form. The Rococo Revival  style was very popular throughout the 19th century and by the 1880s  it dominated commercial manufacture, especially in silver and  gilt metal.",
