            "public_access_description": "The tomb of Cecilia Metella on the Via Appia in Rome was built around 79 BC. The prominent location on one of the most important roads to Rome became a site for monumental tombs of the ancient Roman elite. The inscription on the tomb, also visible on this hardstone picture, reads as follows: CAECILIAE / Q. CRETICI F. / METELLAE CRASSI, or \"To Caecilia Metella, daughter of Quintus Creticus, [and wife] of Crassus\". Born around 100 BC into the important Caecilius Metellus family, she was one of many women with this name. \nTo the present day the tomb of Cecilia Metella is one of the most impressive and celebrated sights along the Appian Way. In medieval times the tomb became part of a fortress.\n\nThis picture is based upon a design by the Roman painter Ferdinando Partini which was created as part of a series of six views of ancient Roman monuments. Between 1794 and 1798 four paintings were reproduced in Pietre Dure for the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. In 1799 after the arrival of French troops in Florence, two of these pictures and other treasures were sent to Paris, and only returned after Napoleon's fall in 1815. Grand Duke Leopold II gave this picture Pope Pius IX to celebrate his visit to Florence in 1857.\n\nThe picture shows the ability of Florentine masters to create landscapes in Pietre Dure, the European tradition of hardstone carving established in Italy in the 16th century. The selection of stones, such as alabaster for the sky and various shades of veined marble for the stonework of the tomb create the impression of a sunny day with sun-lit and shadow zones on the wall of the tomb evoked by the use of different marbles. In addition the alabaster background of sky has been painted from behind to give the effect of clouds.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

These paintings, signed and dated, are preserved in the Museo dell'Opificio.  The composition, architecture, coat of arms and frieze decorating the tomb were copied from an etching by Giambattista Piranesi of 1762.  Three of the paintings were executed in pietre dure: the views of the Pantheon, the Arch of Janus, and the Tomb of Cecilia Metella - all three taken by the French in 1799 - but the Pantheon and the Tomb of Cecilia Metella were returned to Florence.  In 1857 the Tomb of Cecilia Metella was presented to Pope Pius IX by Leopold II, and a replica in pietre dure was made in 1862, which is still preserved in the Museo dell'Opificio.  The version in the Gilbert Collection, as noted by Gonzalez-Palacios, is the original one. Cecilia Metalla, a loved Roman heroine, was the fourth wife of Lucius Cornelius Sylla, dictator of Rome (r. 82-79 BC).\n\nProvenance: Ferdinand III of Lorraine; Palazzo Pitti; Opificio delle Pietre Dure, Florence; Pope Pius IX; Giorgio Rovelli, Rome, 1971;  Los Angeles County Museum of Art\n\nHistorical significance: One of the most celebrated Roman archaeological sites, the tomb is also known as the <i>Capo di Bove</i> because of the frieze of<i> bucrania</i> - stylized ox skulls, running beneath the battlements.  The circular tower was built in 79BC. It was later converted into a fortress for the Gaetani family by their relative Pope Boniface VIII.\n\nIt became a famous resting place along the Appian Way for tourists.",
