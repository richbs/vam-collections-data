De Troy chose to depict the moment directly after Jason has thrown a stone into the midst of the warriors, his right arm still extended behind him. Medea and her father, Aaeetes, are seated on the left. Aeetes gestures in surprise, while Medea, who has protected Jason with her magic, is clearly relieved to see her lover escape death yet again. Queen Eidyia and Medea's sister, Chalciope, are also present. Chalciope converses with one the Argonauts, presumably one of her sons (either Telamon or Augeias). The bulls of Mars are clearly visible behind the skirmish. The whole scene is set against the backdrop of the palace of Cytaeon Aeetes.",

            "public_access_description": "The mythological story of Jason is synonymous with adventure and great feats of heroism. This tapestry belongs to a cycle of seven works relating the story of Jason's voyage with the Argonauts; their quest to capture the golden fleece, and their subsequent return to Greece. Particular emphasis is placed on one aspect of the story that is seldom explored: Jason and Medea.The cycle was woven in the celebrated Gobelins workshop to cartoons by Fran\u00e7ois de Troy.\n\nThird in the cycle, this tapestry illustrates the second challenge King Aeetes issued to Jason during his quest. Having defeated the bulls of Mars, Jason was instructed to yoke the beasts and plough the field with them, sowing a serpent's teeth as he went. An army of men would rise up from the earth in the teeth's place, with whom Jason would have to do battle and defeat before the day was done. With this task Aeetes proposed to test Jason's courage and strength, and yet, both he and Jason knew it would be impossible. Jason appealed to Medea, Aeetes's daughter, who gave Jason magical herbs to protect him, confiding that he should wait until the men had grown and then throw a stone in amongst them. The men would then turn on each other, the resulting confusion enabling Jason to defeat them.\n\nIn this tapestry De Troy chose to depict the moment directly after Jason has thrown a stone into the midst of the warriors, his right arm still extended behind him. Medea and Aeetes, who are seated on the left, look on at the ensuing chaos. Aeetes gestures in surprise, while Medea is clearly relieved to see her lover escape death yet again.",

Forming lot 322, the tapestries were consigned by the 2nd Baroness Burton, Nellie Lisa Melles. Their remarkable provenance was related in the sale catalogue as follows:\n\n\n'In 1787 these seven tapestries were given by the State to the Comte de Vergennes, Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1774, on the occasion of the successful completion of a commercial treaty with England. The set was, between the years 1800 and 1820, purchased by William Murray who succeeded in 1796 as 3rd Earl of Mansfield of Caen Wood, Co. Middx. The set probably hung at his house of Caen Wood, now know as Kenwood, until its sale about 1870 by William David Murray, 4th Earl in 1840, to Mr. Michael Thomas Bass, father of the 1st Lord Burton.'\n\n\nOnce purchased, it was Sir Leigh Ashton's intention that the tapestries \"would be utilised to form a background to the Jones collection which has hitherto had to exist in the rather chaste splendour of a bare gallery; but, equally, if the Fund are prepared to contribute and wished, for instance, to present part of the set to Ken Wood(sic), where they were originally hung, this would, I think, be worth considering.\". It was Lady Burton's wish that the tapestries should at some point be shown at Kenwood, but Ashton felt the museum should have 'one great complete set of Gobelins'. (MA/1/C1401/7)\n\nAccording to Fenaille, eleven cycles and several individual scenes (79 tapestries in total) were woven at the Gobelins. This does not include the cycles that constituted private commissions for the royal palaces and diplomatic gifts for foreign dignitaries. Though it was expected that tapestry cycles would be re-woven, as and when required, the popularity of de Troy's story of Jason cycle was clearly such that it led Jean-Baptiste-Marie Pierre, director of the Gobelins in 1783, to remark that the subject had been 'done to death' (letter dated 11 February 1783, cited in Leribault, 2002, p.104).\n\nThe cartoon is in the mus\u00e9e des Augustins, Toulouse.",
