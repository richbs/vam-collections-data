            "public_access_description": "Isaac Oliver died in 1617, shortly before Nicholas Hilliard (1547-1619), who had taught him the techniques of miniature painting. But Oliver had long since gained the ascendant in terms of innovation. \n\nWhen Oliver first studied with Hilliard he was already a trained artist, imbued with sophisticated ideas about art. His visit to Italy, unprecedented for an English artist, is indicative of his interest in Continental European art. This can be seen in this unusual picture of the classical goddess Diana, identified by the crescent moon in her headdress. Oliver\u2019s miniature is probably copied from part of a Dutch mythological painting. This miniature is also unusual, being painted on cambric rather than on the traditional vellum support, and would probably be unattributable to the artist were it not signed \u2018IO\u2019.",

Full Citation:\n\n\u201cISAAC OLIVER\n\n<b>174 Diana</b>, 1615\n\n<i>Victoria & Albert Museum (P.9-1940)</i>\nGouache on sized cambric laid down on to a thin panel of limewood, oval, 86 x 64 mm, 3 3/8 x 2 17/32 in.\n\nUnique amongst Oliver\u2019s <i>oeuvre</i> both in technique and subject matter, this is a miniature of outstanding quality comparable to the one of his wife (no. 173) or the full length of Dorset (no. 276).  The identity as Diana is secured by the crescent-moon in her head-dress.  This is the only miniature in which Oliver embarks onto subject matter normally the preserve of his drawings.  The stylistic source is Dutch mannerist mythological painting of the type stemming from Spranger via Goltzius, indeed, the miniature suggests, that it is copied from part of a mythological picture.  This is perfectly possible as the Low Countries and Venice were the two sources drawn upon for the formation of picture collections in early seventeenth century England the earliest of which were Prince Henry\u2019s and Robert Cecil\u2019s.  The Prince\u2019s we know included substantial purchased of Netherlandish pictures.  His mother also collected and a <i>Diana and her Nymphs</i> is recorded at Oatlands, a picture which may have been hers but might equally have come to her on Henry\u2019s death (O. Millar, <i>The Queen\u2019s Pictures</i>, London, 1977, p. 24). The edges have been trimmed in modern times.\n\nINSCRIBED: To the right: <i>1615 / IO</i> (in monogram).\n\nCOLLECTIONS: H. Reynolds Solly sale, Sotheby\u2019s 27th June 1940 (lot 136); purchased with funds from the R. H. Stephenson Bequest.\n\nLITERATURE: V&A, 1947 (193).\u201d",
