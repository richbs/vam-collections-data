Dennis worked in the toy industry for a company called Lines Brothers Ltd, they were mostly famous for their Tri-ang range of toys.  Dennis was a sculptor and worked in the research and development of new toys for the company in particular the dolls which were produced under the Pedigree trade name.  The catalogues highlight that their range of dolls are realistic and produced by a sculptor.   We do not know when Dennis started working at the factory but we know that he was an influential figure in the designing of their most popular doll Sindy, which was produced in 1963.  \n\nThis collected includes dolls from other manufactures as he would have collected them to inspire new ideas.  They are often just heads, which was not uncommon as these were usually exported in large numbers and the bodies made at their destination as it was a cheap way to manufacture.  The collection also includes moulds and experimental pieces from the factory as well as complete ones in their presentation boxes.\n\nThis plastic Pedigree doll is one of a set produced by the Tri-ang company. Other dolls that were available in the range were a judge, bishop, beefeater, lifeguard and right noble order of the garter. This doll appears to not be of as high a quality as other toys that Pedigree produced. It is possible that this range was made for wholesalers and then would have been sold to tourists as souvenirs.",
