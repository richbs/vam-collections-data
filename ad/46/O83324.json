It is thought to be the night of the Last Supper before Christ was crucified. A traditional Christian ceremony, it  included the washing of the feet of the poor by religious leaders or monarchs in memory of Christ's washing the feet of his disciples. The word 'Maundy' comes from the Latin maundatum, meaning 'command',  from the instruction that Christ gave 'that ye love one another', recorded in the Bible (John 13: 34).\n\n\n\nHistorical Associations\n\nIn England as early as the 13th century the monarch participated in the Maundy ceremony with gifts of food and money. During the reign of Elizabeth I (1588-1603), silver pennies were distributed.  The tradition of coins specially minted for Maundy began with Charles II (ruled 1660-1685) in 1662, with the issue of one, two, three and four penny pieces.",

Their importance is underlined  by the almost total lack of other good visual material for this period, whether pictorial or in the form of surviving garments.  In particular, the survival of accessories and the informal garments is extremely rare.",
