The necklace consists of six openwork rosette plaques of very thin gold sheet, alternating with five similar enamelled plaques.  Each of the rosette plaques is decorated in the centre with a ring of three domes and three pearls, with an additional pearl in the centre.  Two short wire pendants threaded with pearls hang from the lower edge of each rosette.  The four outer alternating plaques are each set with a square central garnet in a closed mount, and are decorated with touches of blue enamel.  One also has black enamel.  Each has three wire pendants hanging from its lower edge threaded with pearls and ending in a red glass bead.  The central plaque is similar to the other four, but has three garnets in the centre, and its central wire pendant has been replaced by a pendant resembling the plaques with garnet centres.  This additional pendant is suspended from the central plaque in the necklace by a small disc with an enamelled Maltese cross on its face, and has three further enamelled Maltese cross pendants, with pearls and red beads, hanging from its lower edge, together with two wire pendants with pearls and red beads.  The necklace may be incomplete, as there is no fastening.",
