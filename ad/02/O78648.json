Wine coolers were generally made in pairs, and intended to be placed upon the dining table. They usually had handles and a detachable collar and liner.\n\nHistory & Use\nAs dining became more informal, with fewer diners seated at smaller tables, new forms of table services developed. The use of wine coolers became fashionable at the French court from the end of the 17th century, and was introduced into England at the beginning of the 18th. Generally made of silver, they were used by the court, aristocracy and well-to-do throughout Europe.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis cooler is made of Sheffield plate, which is copper fused with silver.  The basic material of plating was significantly cheaper than sterling silver, and a wide range of domestic goods were produced that imitated the appearance of solid silver yet at half the cost.",
