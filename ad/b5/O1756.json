The designer, Fran\u00e7ois-Eug\u00e8ne Rousseau, inherited a shop in Paris that sold glass and ceramics. He began to design glass around 1867.  At this time he was one of the first to welcome Japanese influence both in his own pieces and work he commissioned from other artists. Most of his designs were made by Appert Fr\u00e8res at Clichy. This vase was shown in the International Exhibition, Paris, in 1878.",
