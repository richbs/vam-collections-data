A number of examples of Mason's work were included in Cybernetic Serendipity, an exhibition held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1968. The same image is reproduced in the book accompanying the exhibition (p.92). According to the Cybernetic Serendipity catalogue, his works were produced using an analogue computer. They were previously displayed at the Salt Lake Art Center, Salt Lake City.\n\nMaughan Sterling Mason was born in Ogden, Utah, in 1931. He received a Master of Science degree in physics in 1953 and went on to become president of the Society for Computer Simulation.
