Full Citation: \n \n\u201c<b>51 Unknown Man \n1655-60 </b>\nEvans 26 \n\n<b>Oval 59 x 48.5 mm </b>\n\nFeatures in bold hatches of brown and sanguine, with black and some white heightening in the eyes, on a thick, pale carnation ground; hair in brown wash, hatched and modelled with darker colour; collar in pale grey wash, modelled and highlighted with white; costume in black wash, pale grey for the buttons and lights; background to the left a hatched brown wash; to the right a blue wash hatched with white; a gold border; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Some fading, especially in the flesh-tones; otherwise sound.  \n \n<b>Signed:</b> Lower right in gold: <i>DDG</i> (see B in Appendix 2).  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Relatively recent, turned oval fruitwood of complex bolection moulding, stained dark brown; the hanger a plain brass ring stapled to the top; the backboard is old and is inscribed in ink by a late seventeenth- or early eighteenth-century hand: Bishop / Dupper.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Not included in the original Wallop loans, so this was perhaps a part of Alan Evans's own small collection of pre-eighteenth-century miniatures, of which he kept no notes of acquisition; bequeathed by Alan Evans to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.)  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 1 S; Murdoch 1981, p. 138, fig. 154 (as of Duppa). \n\nOn grounds of style, this miniature should date from the later 1650s. It has to be compared to Cat. No. 52 (signed and dated 1657) and with WaIter Bockland, (1) which show how Des Granges' style evolved in the 1650s from the very smooth blended manner of, for example, Cat. Nos 48 and 50 towards a more graphic manner, evidently influenced by Cooper. But in this context the present miniature stands out as lively and competent, different from the stiff, doughy productions exemplified by the Bockland. \n\nThe identification as Brian Duppa (1588-1662), Bishop of Winchester, seems to be old, but cannot be right. The standard image of him is by J M Wright (2) and shows a much older man with straggly white hair and a black cap, seated and in ecclesiastical robes. Even allowing for an earlier date than stylistic arguments would suggest, Duppa would have been an older man than the sitter for this miniature appears to be. \nThe costume is not necessarily clerical; it could be legal or academic. The long ringlet on the left, apparently a 'love-lock', and the brisk moustache and exceptionally fine linen suggest a melancholy rather than strictly puritan character in the sitter. \n\n1 Foskett 1972, vol. II, fig. 224; signed and dated 1657. \n2 ChristChurch, Oxford.\u201d",
