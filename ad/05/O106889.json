Techniques passed down to the Egyptians and then to the Romans.  There were major revivals of interest in engraved gems in Europe during the Byantine era, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and again in the 18th and 19th centuries.  This fragment, probably the remains of a vase, part of the rim of which survives, is Roman and dates from the third century.   The flying figure almost certainly Nike, the Greek winged goddess of Victory, and when the vase was complete the whole scene probably portrayed the apotheosis of an emperor.  After death Roman emperors were often raised to the status of a god, and their deification commemorated in various forms.",

He advised on valuations and acted as agent on behalf of the Museum.  From the 1850s until the late 1870s he sold numbers of highly important objects to the Museum, many of which are now among the 'star' objects of the collections.  In 1867 he lent the Museum a large number of objects, including the present one (Loan no. 104), from his stock, charging a rental of 5% of their estimated value.  Most of these objects had been purchased by the Museum by 1873, and 11 were gem-engravings acquired for what is now the Sculpture collection.  On his death Webb left money to the Museum in the form of a trust fund to be used for the purchase of objects.\n\nHistorical significance: Part of a vase.  The flying figure probably represents Nike as part of a scene with the apotheosis of an emperor.",
