The engraver has made a number of errors that have previously hindered identification of the coat of arms. The arms of Howard should be shown with six, not four, crosses crosslet in the first quarter. The arms of Standish should be blazoned 'Sable, three standing dishes' (although another branch of the family is 'azure', as shown here). Here, also, the charges appear to be pierced and have consequently been interpreted previously as annulets. Fortunately, a pair of salvers of 1734 by Robert Abercrombie (sold Sotheby's, June 20, 1974, lot 188) engraved with the same arms and the cipher 'RS' provide the evidence necessary to solve the mystery. (Schroder, 1988, p. 189)\n\nProvenance: Ralph Standish.  Sale, Sotheby's, lot 126, June, 1957.  Sale, Christie's, lot 181, December 12, 1983.\n\nHistorical significance: Only two other tankards by Paul de Lamerie appear to be recorded: an example of 1716 in the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown (Carver and Casey, 1978, cat. no. 30), and another of 1744 in the James. B. Neale Collection at the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven (Houston, 1956, cat. no. 59). It is unclear why de Lamerie should have so neglected certain areas of the standard repertoire, such as tankards and teapots, since he certainly was not above producing other ordinary domestic plate.  Despite the plainness of this tankard, the unusually heavy gauge of the metal, the subtle proportions, and the extravagant use of metal entailed in the casting of the handle and thumbpiece all single it out as the work of a craftsman of exceptional ability.
