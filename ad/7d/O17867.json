The casket was made to commemorate the important role that Albert had played in setting up the project for the exhibition. Appropriately, the figures represent Learning, Science and Philosophy. \n\nF. W. Moody (1824\u201386) designed the casket, O. Gibbons modelled it, and G. Franchi cast and chased it in a 16th-century style.",
