No pantomime dame is complete without a pair of voluminous bloomers, often in red and the subject of time-honoured double-entendres. In comparison, these bloomers, while obviously 'dame' clothes, are relatively subdued, although the white spots somehow hint at vulgarity and the seaside postcard. \n \nThe bloomers are part of a sight gag. The costume to which they belong is a 'ruined' version of the sailor suit in which Sarah sets off to sea (S.288-1989). Her original oufit (S.287-1989) is stylish (for a dame): a dress with a sailor collar, brass buttons and a crisp white pleated skirt, tights striped in red, white and blue, and a jaunty sailor hat, but the real joke comes after Sarah is caught in the storm and destruction is wrought upon the pristine outfit and bloomers.",
