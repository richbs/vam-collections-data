It has an off-white ground with a clear abstract design mainly in primary colours and black, based on Calder's mobiles.  \n\nOn the right is the dominant 'mobile' with seven counter-balanced triangular 'fins'. The uniting stem terminates in a spiral, in heavy black wool. On the upper centre right there is a 'mobile' with ovals of solid colour. From top to bottom there are seven reds ovals, one yellow, and one bright blue.  A similar 'mobile' below has seven red ovals. Above the centre is a small circle in mid-blue, and below left is a yin and yang like symbol in mid-blue and orange, both circles have a slight 3-D effect created by the use of fifteen strands of fine wool for the weft. \n\nOn the left there is a long curving 'mobile' with nineteen ovals. From top to bottom there are ten red, six yellow, one bright blue, one yellow, and one red.  Three circles edge its lower curve in orange, black and mid-blue.  These and a further 'mobile', in the upper left with three blue ovals and one red, have a slight 3-D effect created by the use of a heavier wool and multiple strands of fine wool for the weft. \n\nRight and left edges are turned and crudely 'herringbone' hemmed.",

            "public_access_description": "Alexander Calder is considered to have been one of the most influential sculptors of the 20th century.  Originally an engineer, his understanding of mechanics influenced his later work as an artist.  Calder's method of bending and twisting wire to create three dimensional forms has been described as 'drawing with wire' and his invention of the mobile subsequently shaped the world of modern art.  In 1926, after moving to Paris, Calder created Cirque Calder, a unique collection of work that had been designed to be manipulated by Calder himself, a grown up version of the puppet show.  The basis for each piece was a wire skeleton, adorned with leather, cloth and found materials.  In 1962 Calder designed a group of tapestries to be woven in Aubusson, famous for its weaving workshops.  The influence of the mobile can be seen in Autumn Leaves, in both the abstract form and bold vibrant colours.",

Illustrated p.7 in 'International Directory of Art' 11th edition, vol. 2, 1973 [USA].\nThroughout the twentieth century, the Museum has actively collected contemporary textiles, ranging from unique tapestries created independently by artist-weavers to those like this Calder, works made in large ateliers by professional weavers following designs by well-known painters and sculptors. At the time of this acquisition, a choice had to be made between the Calder and a tapestry by Sonia Delaunay; the director, John Pope-Hennessy, was adamant that it should be the Calder.\nIn 1971 Calder worked closely with Jean Pinton to produce a series of twenty-six tapestries that included Autumn Leaves. In its scale, its motifs, and its bright, clear colours set off by black and white, the tapestry is reminiscent of Calder's famous mobiles. The artist first designed textiles in 1929, although his energies from 1930 to 1962 were largely devoted to sculpture. He returned to the design of textiles in 1962, when he began a collaboration with French tapestry workshops that continued until his death.\n\nLit.

This most recent series is perhaps the most important, the tapestries revealing a successful interpretation of the cartoons by highly skilled weavers.  Each work bears the artist's signature and the mark of the weaver.  The warp is cotton and the weft mainly high grade Australian wool, handspun and carefully dyed for each tapestry.  This particular work has strong links with Calders' mobiles and stabiles both in the abstract form and the bold vibrant colours.",
