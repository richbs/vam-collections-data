The elephant, named Hanno, was given to the Pope by King Manoel of Portugal in 1514, although it never visited Florence, dying in Rome in 1516. \nLeo X (born Giovanni di Lorenzo de Medici in 1475, Pope 1513-1521) was noted for his extravagant tastes and love of pomp. A great patron of the Arts, Leo X drew to his Court such artists as Michelangelo and Raphael. The glory of his reign, however, was blighted by the spread of the Reformation and the incriminations of Martin Luther.\nThe depiction of contemporary historical events is rarely found on maiolica, rendering this a particularly interesting scene. Although the Pope's elephant did not make the journey to Florence, it had appeared in Papal processions in Rome. Rumours of the beast and the Pope's love of splendour and parade had obviously spread to Montelupo, and Leo X's visit to the city of his birth was no doubt a great occasion.",

A great patron of the Arts, Leo X drew to his Court such artists as Michelangelo and Raphael. The glory of his reign, however, was blighted by the spread of the Reformation and the incriminations of Martin Luther.",
