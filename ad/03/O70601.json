Its shape derives from German stoneware jugs commonly used in Holland at that time. Dutch orders for Chinese porcelain in the 1630s had already included such jugs, which were copied either from turned and painted wooden models or from stoneware originals, and it is likely that similar means were used when placing orders in Japan. The coat of arms on this piece suggests that it was a special order made for Pieter de Graeff (1638-1707), who became a Director of the Dutch East India Company in 1664. After Japan's adoption of its Closed Door policy in 1639, the Dutch were the only Europeans allowed to trade in Japan, which they did through their base on the island of Dejima in Nagasaki Bay.",
