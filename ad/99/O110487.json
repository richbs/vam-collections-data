In early times, people held them in their hand, but later they raised them high on poles. \n\nBoth altar and processional crosses were generally made of precious or gilded metal, or ivory, and decorated with gems. From about 800 they bore the image of the crucified Christ and became known as crucifixes. By about 1100 the imagery of European crosses had become established. It usually included the symbols of the four Evangelists (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John), often with the Virgin Mary and St John flanking the figure of Christ crucified.\n\nThe mesh-like Gothic ornament on this cross is in a style found only in northern Italy. The knop (the protrusion on the stem) depicts two Franciscan saints, Bernardino of Siena and Francis. Bernardino, who died in 1444, was a preacher renowned for his devotion to the holy name of Jesus. He holds a roundel inscribed with \u2018IHS\u2019, a contraction of the \nname Jesus Christ in Greek.",

Models of the cross begin to appear from about 350 AD, probably for use in private prayer. Only from about 1000 was a cross regularly placed on the altar during Mass; a more ancient custom was to suspend a cross above the altar or to place one beside it. Crosses were also carried in procession before a service. In early centuries these were hand-held, later replaced by more visible crosses raised on staffs.\n\nAltar and processional crosses were generally made of precious or gilt metal, or ivory, and decorated with gems. From about 800 they were adorned with the image of the crucified Christ and became known as crucifixes. By about 1100 the iconography of European crosses had become established, usually including the symbols of the four Evangelists, often with the Virgin Mary and St John the Evangelist flanking the figure of Christ crucified.",
