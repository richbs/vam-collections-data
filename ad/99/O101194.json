Wall-mounted telephones like this one were used in offices, and the box contained the battery and the bell.  Telephones needed large batteries until the early 20th century, when batteries could be centrally located at the telephone exchange, enabling phones to become smaller.\n\nThe modern telephone is credited as the invention of Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, when he registered the first patent for one. Others, namely Johann Phillip Reis and Elisha Gray, had already been experimenting in the 1860s and 1870s with ideas for a voice-transmission version of the telegraph. The Telephone Company of Britain was established in 1878, and the first telephone exchange opened in Britain in London in 1879, connecting just eight subscribers.",
