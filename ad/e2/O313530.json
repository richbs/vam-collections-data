It must have been created in the 1480s by an artist formed in the tradition of Pisanello and also conscious of Florentine influences. The identity of the sitter has been subject to discussions too. The name Astallia is associated with an old Roman family. The aspects shown on the medal and the phoenix on the back suggest a commemorative purpose of the medal.\nPhoenix, the firebird, ended its life in a pile of aromatic woods and spices, which it built for the purpose. It then incarnated from the ashes thus being a symbol for any unique being, immortal Virtue and resurrection.",
