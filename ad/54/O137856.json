They were made in sets, diminishing in size and with hollow spikes so that they could be stacked one on top of the other. This type of candlestick was made in the second half of the thirteenth and the early fourteenth century. This example includes the Italian arms of the city of Florence, a cardinal of the Orsini family and the Aldobrandini family.\n\n Coats of arms upon such candlesticks were popular as decorative motifs and were probably often purely decorative. A rare set of six stacking candlesticks in the Louvre include the arms of France, Champagne and Turenne, arms frequently used in the production of Limoges enamels. This example includes the Italian arms of the city of Florence, a cardinal of the Orsini family and the Aldobrandini family.",

A rare set of six stacking candlesticks in the Louvre include the arms of France, Champagne and Turenne, arms frequently used in Limousin production. This example includes the Italian arms of the city of Florence, a cardinal of the Orsini family and the Aldobrandini family.",
