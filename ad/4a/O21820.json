The bowl is undecorated while the foot is incised with lines to simulate petal veins, all beneath a celadon glaze. There are gold lacquer repairs and firing faults on both parts.\n\nThe flange of this beautiful cup stand is in the form of a six-petalled flower whose leaf veins are expressed as double incised lines. The centre of the stand is in the shape of a cup and is not pierced through. A pale bluish glaze covers the whole surface of the stand. The outward-slanting foot of the base has traces of silica spurs in four places. Parts of the rim and the flange have been repaired in gold lacquer. The cup stand was made at a kiln in Sadang-ri, Gangjin, in the early 13th century.",
