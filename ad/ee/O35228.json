This is primarily due to his ground breaking developments in the colour lithographic process, but can also be attributed to his prolific output and ostentatious style: Ch\u00e9ret was capable of rendering even the most banal of subjects sensational. His posters were so popular with the Parisian public that it was rumoured devotees would go out in the middle of the night in order to remove his posters from the walls and add them to their collection.",
