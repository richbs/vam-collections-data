He became an official War Artist during the First World War and a major exponent of the revival of wood engraving between the wars.  The most fruitful portion of his career was the 1920s, during which the primitivising tendencies of his earlier work combined with ideas being promoted by Roger Fry and the Bloomsbury group, resulting in evocative yet tightly constructed landscapes.",
