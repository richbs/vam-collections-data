His son Hermann August Kaehler (1846-1917) began experimenting with lustred glazes in the late 1880s. The pottery became best known for these special glazes, with their silvered, reddened colouring often with a 'crackled'  surface - as in this vase. In 1900 he won a silver medal in the international exhibition, Paris. After his death and with the pottery named Kaehler Keramik, his sons Herman J Kaehler and  Nils A. Kaehler continued making lustred wares into the 1920s, specialising in painted decoration rather than a more simple overall glaze (see 251-154-1894) . Jens Thirslund (1897-1942) was their chief designer.  Thirslund trained initially as a housepainter, but subsequently studied Persian ceramics and married into the Kaehler family.",
