The shoes appear to be moulded and formed in one section. The shoes are a classic clog shape with open backs and a hinged sling back strap attached with a plastic rivet with the Crocs cartoon crocodile logo on the circular rivet on both sides of the shoe. \nThe strap can be worn forward or back to provide extra support. The front top area of the shoes have thirteen perforated holes uniformly punched out. Around the sides of the toe area there are a further 6 shaped cutouts to allow the foot to breathe and also to allow wear in water - for the water to drain out. The shoes have a moulded tread on the bottom of the soles and also inside the shoes for the underside of the foot to grip to. The shoes are also branded with the company name across the front of the sling back straps.\n[accessories] Plastic 'Jibbitz' accessory button depicting a ladybird to wear popped in to holes in Crocs shoes.\n[accessories] Plastic 'Jibbitz' accessory button depicting a pig to wear popped in to holes in Crocs shoes.\n[leaflet] Instruction leaflet for 'Jibbitz' accessory button to wear popped in to holes in Crocs shoes.",

They developed a shoe initially conceived as suitable for use on boats out of a new material, PCCR, similar to plastics and rubbers, but with new technology the shoes were washable, largely odourless, durable and safe. \nThe brightly coloured shoes formed entirely in the same material now come in a range of different styles, the original model was based on the shape of a tradiational clog with a sling back strap. \nThe shoes have enjoyed a wave of popularity since 2002 particularly in the children's market, due to their practicality and bright colours. Crocs, perhaps because of their unusual appearence have become a hugely popular international brand and have been replicated by many other manufacturers globally.",
