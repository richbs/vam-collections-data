            "public_access_description": "In 1897, following a series of frustrated attempts to end a monopoly on palm oil and various other commodities held by the Oba (king) of Benin, the British led a punitive raid on Benin City. Justification for this brutal event was sought, in the British press, by depicting the Oba and his people as \u2018savages\u2019 who practised human sacrifice. However, the elaborately carved ivories and cast brass plaques and sculpture seized from the royal court, and dispersed to British museum collections, were evidence of a sophisticated and technologically-advanced society.\n\nThis unsavoury aspect of British history was reflected on by artist Tony Phillips in a 1984 series of etchings, History of the Benin Bronzes. In the series, Phillips adopts the unusual technique of reusing a printing plate to create a second image, with elements of the first image still visible. Thus, in this image, the eleventh in the suite of twelve plates, we revisit a cast bronze figure first pictured at the \u2018Shrine of Sacrifice\u2019 (scene three, E.50-1987) to find it standing on a plinth next to a TV in a European living room. The schematic way in which the home environment is depicted emphasises the means by which the figure has been forcibly removed from its original context.",
