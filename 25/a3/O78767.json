When this dye book was issued, the firm was a world leader in the field. It later became famous for pharmaceuticals, in particular for the discovery of aspirin.\n\nStrong Anglo-German competition was at the root of the development of aniline dyes. Bayer was one of several German companies to capitalise on the early discoveries in dye technology made by British chemists.  William Perkin, who discovered the first artifical dyestuff mauveine in 1856, had been a pupil of the German chemist Hoffman. Early artificial dyes did not last very long but  competitive research provided improvements in colourfastness and dyeing qualities. \n\nThis dye book shows the vast range of dyes available 40 years after the discovery of mauveine. The Bayer firm's first significant production was the Magenta dye. This sample book shows examples of a second generation of aniline-derived dyes and includes the evocatively named 'Alkali Blue', 'Alkali Violet', 'Bismark Brown' and 'Acid Magenta'.",
