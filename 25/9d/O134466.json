He works with various media -  paint, woodcarving and printmaking - but the linocut is especially well-suited to his bold graphic style and balanced compositions. His work often refers to the small details of the natural environment; birds, animals and insects, which in his images become simplified almost to the point of abstraction. \n\nSetshogo gained an international profile through his involvement in the Kuru Art Project, a scheme run by the charity Kuru D\u2019Kar Trust to enable San artists in the Kalahari region of Botswana to benefit financially from their artistic skills. Printmaking was not a traditional craft for the San but the Trust enabled them to transfer images used in ceramic or leather work to lino-cut and lithography. International sales of works on paper helped the San, who were rapidly becoming marginalised in the country's economy in the early 1990s, to maintain a subsistence level of farming.",
