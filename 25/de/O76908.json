This featured an outer band formed from pointed lotus buds, originally silver-inlaid.  A silver-inlaid fillet separated this border from the central rosette, now erased and engraved with a later design. There is also evidence of a continuous band of worn circles.\n\nThis later design  is a whorl formed from eleven half-palmettes on hatched ground to hold black composition.  The roundel is surrounded by five pointed arches with finials that each carry a cusped trefoil.  Within the arches are divergent stalks flanking a cusped trefoil.  Single trilobed lotus flowers are placed in the intervals between the lobed arches.\nThis design is Safavid, possibly the second half of the sixteenth century.\n\nThe exterior sides are entirely filled with the original continuous epigraphic band in naskhi on a scrolling ground.\n\n\n\nPatina: brassy yellow with small green oxide deposits on the rim on one limited area probably due to prolonged exposure to humidity.",
