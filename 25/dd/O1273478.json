By his mid-teens Francis was working as an assistant for a West End photographic studio. His early photographs offer a personal record of the world around him. The intimate scenes of everyday black British family life that he recorded were largely absent from media and cultural representation of the black British community at the time. \n\nThe V&amp;A acquired nine photographs by Armet Francis as part of the Staying Power project. Photographs by his contemporaries Neil Kenlock and Charlie Phillips were also acquired as part of the project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
