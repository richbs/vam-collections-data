A tribal people controlled by village chiefs assisted by the priest-shaman. The name Muhso/Muser means \"hunter\" and suggests their skill in the chase. The Lahus are divided into a number of related sub-groups, including the Black Lahu and the Red Lahu. They are great weavers and are famed for their intricate basketwork. Practicing slash and burn agriculture the Lahus cultivate rice, and chilli and opium, which they smoke themselves or sell as a cash crop.\n\nThe long coat is the particular garment of all of the Lahu - both men and women - decorative elements distinguishing the different sub- groups. It is worn over either a pair of pants or a sarong together with a colourful shoulder bag (see IM 146-1929) and a black turban.",
