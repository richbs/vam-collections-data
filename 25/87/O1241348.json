He established himself as a skilled and often controversial director, introducing British audiences to the plays of Russian dramatists and staging unconventional productions of Shakespeare at Stratford-upon-Avon. His first production at Stratford was The Merchant of Venice in 1932, and he also directed and designed Macbeth, The Merry Wives of Windsor, King Lear, The Comedy of Errors and The Taming of the Shrew. He did not direct a production of Henry IV Part II, though both parts of Henry IV were staged in 1932 to open the new Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, directed and designed by W. Bridges-Adams.",
