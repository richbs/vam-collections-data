There is a pink rosette where the lines cross.  In the centre of each diamond is a small roundel in gold with pink and green details.  There is a weaving fault: with the blue section down the right hand side, in the 6th band of lozenges, both the central roundels and the rosettes are mis-shapen. The ground of each diamond is filled with fine gold blossoms, stems and leaves. There is an added border of bias cut woven silk and metal thread along the bottom and the right hand side; edged with black, probably cotton fabric.\nA section of fabric with an almost identical design on a blue ground has been sewn down the right hand side.  The diamonds are slightly more condensed and the motif in the centre of each is circular. \nThere is a border which has been pieced many times: bias cut gold-green ground with a fine black stem meander linking a blue and white flower and a pink blossom, each of which has a white serrated flower growing from a curving stem.\nAll three components seem to have been attached to a green silk backing.",
