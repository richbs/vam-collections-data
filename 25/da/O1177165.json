It was produced by Robert Helpmann and included new choreography by Frederick Ashton, Rudolf Nureyev and Maria Fay. It was intended that Nureyev would dance in the premiere on 12 December 1963, but injury prevented this. He first performed the role of Prince Siegfried on 6 March 1964, dancing opposite Margot Fonteyn. The production took place when Nureyev was at the height of his powers as a charismatic dancer. It continued to be performed until 1970. Nureyev danced 26 performances of the production with the Royal Ballet in London and the USA and continued to use the costume when he appeared as a guest artist with other companies in Swan Lake. He also wore it on television.\n\nShort, figure-hugging tunics were Nureyev's preferred style for classical ballet. This costume was a personal favourite and he appears to have had several versions of it made, all slightly modifying Carl Toms' original design to suit his physique. These include one in dark brown which was displayed in the Nureyev Exhibition at Moulin sur Allier (2009). Nureyev may be seen wearing variants of the costume in many photographs.",
