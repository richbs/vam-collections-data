In the centre a corn-field is being harvested, around it stand small bundles of hay in neat circles. A harvester is being driven by a man and three horses. Three men to the left chase a rabbit whilst another man hunts in the corn, and in the foreground another rabbit is being chased by two dogs. A man has just fallen over a bundle of hay whilst chasing the rabbit; his hat lies nearby. Against another bundle of hay a boy and girl sit watching and another man chases a dog away to the right. In the background another man is shooting at something. In the foreground to the left are two bicycles to which are tied four rabbits. The field is framed by a typical English countryside of trees and ploughed fields. There is a dark blue border with a scalloped edge.",

An accomplished printmaker, Nash helped found the Society of Wood Engravers in 1920, and produced a number of woodcut or -engraved book illustrations for Private Press publishers such as the Golden Cockerel Press in the 1920s and 1930s. \n\nSet up in 1945 by Brenda Rawnsley, the School Prints scheme commissioned well-known artists to create lithographs, which would then be printed in large numbers and sold cheaply to schools for display in classrooms; the aim was to give 'school children an understanding of contemporary art'. Each lithograph had a drawn frame so that the print could be pinned to the wall. In the spirit of post-war optimism, artists responded enthusiastically. The scheme was a unique attempt at giving children access to original works of art in a period of austerity but ended in 1949 because of financial problems. Many of the prints depict a familiar world of everyday rural or urban life, some presenting a version of the pastoral idyll and others scenes of entertainment or leisure.",

Tomlinson, London County Council Senior Inspector of Art. Many of the prints depict a familiar world of everyday rural or urban life, some presenting a version of the pastoral idyll (John Nash 'Harvesting') and others scenes of festivity (Barbara Jones 'Fairground'), entertainment (L.S.
