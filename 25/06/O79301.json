There are 41 beads, including some facetted cubes, and 1 \u2018mulberry\u2019 type made from groups of granule pyramids, with a long hollow conical terminal bead at each end.  The beads are strung on white cotton, with a short length of chain at each end, beyond the terminal beads, ending in a simple hook and eye.  In the centre of the necklace is a small rectangular amulet case, which does not open, with three loops at the top attaching it to the cord, and three hollow bead pendants hanging from the base by figure-of-eight links.  It is surrounded by 16 matching pendants, eight on each side.  14 of the pendants consist of a plain disc with a figure-of-eight link and a pendent hollow bead.  The two end pendants have a quatrefoil instead of a disc.  The different parts of each pendant are joined together by discs covered with granule rosettes.",
