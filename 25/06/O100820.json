The pseudo lattice is composed of horizontal zigzags of elongated, stylized leaves: 3 zigzags in yellow, one in red and blue, and 1 in blue and green.  Each leaf has a central stem bearing rosettes.  The yellow ones also contain pairs of cloud bands in 2 colours.  In the long panels are mythical beasts.  The topmost pair are spotted dragons with floral tails.  In each of the lower is a pair of embattled animals.  In the outer triangles are, at the bottom, elaborate cones; there is a third one in the centre at the top, and above, a palmette, a composite blossom and, at the top, a pair of small spotted animals.  Further large blossoms link the zigzags.  The motifs in the right hand of the carpet seem to be less finely woven - details are lacking.  It suggests 2 different weavers working from a drawing, not a cartoon.\n\nBorder: missing from bottom and from top right hand corner.  It has been rewoven.  White ground with an angular floral meander.  The downward diagonals are decorated hexagonals.  The meander links these with large yellow rosettes from which sprout purple and blue lilies.\n\n(analysed through glass).  10.3.1999",
