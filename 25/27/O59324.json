At that time the Museum regularly purchased pieces from such exhibitions as examples of the very highest technical skill. They were intended to inspire young British designers and those learning crafts and trades. The Museum paid \u00a364 for this mirror frame, a very high price at that time. \n\nMany firms produced pieces for international exhibitions that reflected a historical tradition in their home country. Italian firms frequently used the technique of ebony and ivory marquetry, imitating the finest cabinets produced in Naples in about 1600. Giovanni Battista Gatti was one of the most inventive and skilled 19th-century cabinetmakers to use this technique.",
