By the later 1620s the soft linen 'falling band' was replacing the ruff as fashionable neckwear, usually trimmed with a deep border of bobbin lace, such as this example which would have been worn by a man.   \n\nThis new style of collar can be seen in many of Anthony Van Dyck's portraits of men.\nFlemish bobbin lace, with its draping qualities, dominated fashion at that time.  Light and delicate, made with finer thread and more open patterns than Italian lace, it was ideally suited to this soft and fluid style.\n\nThis lace, shaped for a collar, has been sewn to a modern reproduction to illustrate how it was worn.",
