Heavy looting followed, and when this was stopped, the contents of his treasury were formally divided between the victorious British soldiers according to rank, in accordance with the conventions of the day. The cane was transferred, with other parts of the collections of the Indian Museum, to the South Kensington Museum in 1879.",
