Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nPhilip Sajet (born 1953) studied at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam. His approach has been described by David Watkins as a 'blend of matter-of-fact attitude with sophisticated insider intelligence'. This duality is expressed in this ring which unites a bold and innovative form with a subtle appreciation of historic jewellery: the rock crystal is faceted to resemble a very early diamond cut, while its prominent setting is reminiscent of some medieval rings.",
