The letters are to be distributed one to each player, according to the number about to play, and the remainder laid aside.  They are used to mark each player's position o the Game.\n3.

Each player, on drawing a number, is to place his letter on the same number in the Game, and read the description aloud.  When it is his turn to draw another, he adds them together and advances his letter to that number which they make when so added, reading as before, and observing any directions which may be given him.  But if he draw a cross, he is to draw again, till he obtain a number, which number is to be deducted from, instead of added to his former station, and his letter moved back accordingly.

After each player has drawn once, the Game is to be continued in the same manner, passing the bag round, till some one makes up the exact number 151, who wins the Game.\n7.  If a player go beyond No. 151, he must go as many back as he had exceeded it, and the lottery must continue till some one makes up the exact number.\n8.  If two players arrive at the same number, the one who arrived last must go back to his former number. \n9.  When a player is sent back to any place, he is not to read the description, or attend to the directions in italics, and when sent forward he is only to read the description and stop there till his turn to draw again.\n\nThere follows the EXPLANATION or Description of each of the stops with the additional rules:  Should  the game be considered too long, the Players may read only the words printed in italics..\n\nEdward Wallis was at Skinner Street until 1847 when the premises and business was taken over by J Passmore.\n\n\n\nRules placement: booklet, E. 1781-1954",
