It was also less expensive to produce clear glass than coloured glass, and many churches resorted to this more cost-effective option.\n\nThe leaves on this panel are depicted realistically and can be recognised as vine and maple.\n\nOriginally, this panel came from the Furstenkappelle of the convent of Lichtenthal, Baden-Baden, in Germany.",

The predominant use of clear glass with minimal painted decoration meant that more strong light could pass into the church. It was also less expensive to produce clear glass rather than coloured glass and many churches resorted to this more cost effective option.\n\nThe leaves on this panel are depicted realistically and can be recognised as vine and maple.\n\nThe original location for this panel was the Furstenkappelle of the convent of Lichtenthal, Baden-Baden, in Germany.",
