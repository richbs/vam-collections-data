This has a curved arch at the top but the piece is otherwise very plain. There are slots and grooves in the back of the dresser which suggest that this was made from a kit probably by a child.\n[Table] Circular table probably made from a kit, supported by two rectangular slatted sections held together at each side by a piece of wood.\n[Chair] Painted white chair probably made from a kit by a child.\n[Chair] Painted white chair probably made from a kit by a child\n[Chair] Painted white chair with heart shaped detail carved into vertical slat at back.
