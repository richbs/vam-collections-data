Henderson started out as a painter and his first book illustrations for the Romaunt of the Rose, in 1908, come from this painterly past. Later, he worked in advertising, designing posters for London Transport and the Empire Marketing Board. A connection between advertising and book jacket design was being established at this time and many poster artists like Henderson also designed book jackets.  \n\nIn his later illustrations, Henderson preferred to use scraperboard for images which combined boldness with decorative effects. A drawing board coated in white clay and covered with black ink, from which the ink is scraped away to reveal the white, was developed towards the end of the 19th century for the book industry to replace wood-engraving, but was also widely used in advertising from the 1920s until the 1950s.",
