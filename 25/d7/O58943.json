Following a famous gathering of harpists in Belfast in 1792, harp societies were formed in Belfast in 1808 and Dublin in 1809.  Unlike the Welsh harp, which had three rows of strings, the Irish version has only one, and the traditional Irish technique is to play with fingernails as opposed to the flesh of the fingertips.",
