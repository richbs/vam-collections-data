Already known for his poetry and artist's books, in the 1990s Kenny began to make boxed works using meticulously arranged scraps of text excavated from old books, fragments of old maps, or natural objects such as leaves and twigs.  \n\nKenny harvests the raw material for his witty twig pieces, which he always calls 'drawings', from one particular bush on Hampstead Heath near Kenwood House. He then 'edits' them by trimming to length, and painstakingly glues each 'drawing' together before arranging them supported on stainless steel pins so that they 'float' in front of the backboard.  As he explains, 'There is a resonance in found materials \u2013 materials that have a past life \u2013 whether they are text in a book, a previous narrative, or part of a living thing such as a plant or a tree. This inherited meaning sits alongside any new meaning brought about by a new context'.",
