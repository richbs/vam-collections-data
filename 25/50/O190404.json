The flint gave the material tremendous strength and allowed very thin potting. Around 1740 Staffordshire potters revived the slip-casting technique, which had been invented by the Elers brothers in the 1690s but had not been used since that time. This process involved pouring liquid clay into hollow plaster moulds in which the wares were formed. The great advantage of moulds is that they allowed the manufacture of complex and highly irregular shapes in bulk. Liberated from the circular forms dictated by the potter\u2019s wheel, Staffordshire potters responded by making vessels in wildly imaginative shapes, in doing so creating some of the first European novelty teapots, a ceramic genre that still flourishes today. Factories bought in designs for such wares in the form of \u2018block moulds\u2019 (the convex \u2018master models\u2019 from which concave manufacturing moulds were made) from specialist craftsmen. \n\nThe widening habit of drinking tea and coffee created a huge demand for such wares, both at home and in the growing export markets in continental Europe and the American colonies, and this gave the Staffordshire Potteries a huge boost as the area began to industrialize in the early eighteenth century.",
