The series R\u00e9sidence Astral (1993-2005) is a study of Ryley\u2019s grandmother\u2019s apartment in Brussels photographed over a twelve year period that included the drama of a house fire and subsequent hospitalisation of her grandmother and uncle and clearance and redecoration of the home. As Val Williams has written, Ryley uses her photographs, which often focus on interior details or intimate gestures, to \u2018transform this unremarkable dwelling into an allegory of growing up, combining love with fear to a remarkable degree\u2019.",
