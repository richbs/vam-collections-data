There are six silver keys of which three are original and three appear to be later additions. The three original keys are on the lower joint and are mounted on blocks in the wood; they comprise a G sharp key (for the little finger), and the normal E flat and C keys, the latter with fish-tailed touch. The other three keys are mounted on nickel-silver saddles screwed to the wood, and comprise an octave key for the left thumb and a side B flat key for the right forefinger, these both being on the upper joint; and an F key on the lower joint, this having a square key-plate, whereas with the other keys of the instrument the plate is round. Two double holes. In the bell, two vent holes and an internal flange'.
