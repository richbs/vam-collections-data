They include the Annunciation, the Nativity, the Presentation in the Temple and the Crucifixion, with each scene separated by the Tree of Life. \n\nThe Annunciation scene illustrates the Gospel account in which the Archangel Gabriel greeted the Virgin Mary with the announcement that she would bear a son and his name would be Jesus. The Tree of Life occurs in a hymn for the Virgin Mary by the Armenian mystic Gregory of Narek (951\u20131003). Of the cross he writes, \u2018Blessed are you, holy wood\u2019 and \u2018He is the wood of life for those who seek refuge in him\u2019.",

The earliest eastern churches were established in Antioch, Alexandria and other cities in the 1st century. They were independent communities and theological controversy sharpened their differences.  \n\nIn 330 Constantinople (now Istanbul) became the capital of the Roman empire. Successive bishops of Constantinople, later given the title of patriarch, gradually won authority over other eastern churches, despite the opposition of the pope. Churches that accepted the jurisdiction of the patriarch became known as Orthodox, but others, including those of Armenia and Ethiopia, developed along separate lines. Diversity of practice and doctrine in the eastern churches is reflected in the different kinds of regalia and sacred silver. Yet some forms such as the chalice are common to all, indicating a shared core of beliefs.",
