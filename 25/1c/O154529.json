The boss is an oblate hollow spheroid place off centre near the rear edge.  The tapering tubular handle attaches to the boss, left of the centre line, and then bends a little to the right.  The boss is the origin of a number of chased, closed C scrolls which sweep along the blade and terminate in the scallops of the left and the rear edges.  The C scroll areas are themselves decorated along their length with very short parallel and longitudinal line indents.  The handle is curvaceously irregular, of the nature of a rough branch.  It is decorated with several small flat granulated irregularities, a small round flat lapis lazuli stone and carries a short \"broken\" rod like projection near the finial.  The latter is capped by a rounded, roughly bezelled, labradorite stone.",
