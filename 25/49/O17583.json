It is now recognised as one of the most characteristic works of Jessie Newbery (1864-1948), the main exponent of the Glasgow School style.\n\nPeople\nIn 1894 Jessie Newbery became head of the embroidery department at the Glasgow School of Art. Her teaching was revolutionary. She believed in the importance of form and structure over superficial decoration and encouraged the use of simple, speedy techniques, particularly appliqu\u00e9, to provide fresh, intuitive effects.  She taught to a wide range of students and her Saturday morning classes were organised for primary and secondary teachers and professionals. With the administrative separation of the Glasgow School from English control in 1899 the School had much greater control over its own work which helped encourage a strong, individual style.\n\nMaterials & Making\nNewbery encouraged the use of linens and unusual techniques such as needle weaving (used in the borders of this piece).  The inscription and the stylised roses which form part of the design are both characteristics of her work and ones that were widely copied. Newbery's simple satin stitch lent itself to the linear patterns and inscriptions for which she is now famous.  It also provide the most straightforward means of securing applied motifs.",
