Its case is veneered in boulle marquetry, which was highly fashionable at the time and took its name from Louis XIV's cabinetmaker, Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle. However, Boulle\u2019s workshop was by no means the only one to use this technique, which combined ebony with panels of marquetry in tortoiseshell and brass.",
