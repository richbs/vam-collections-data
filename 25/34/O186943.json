            "physical_description": "Plain weave cotton, plain weave cotton embroidered with silk in straight stitches, trimmed with silk cut velvet and cotton cord and lined with plain weave cotton. Each leg is made from a nakshe panel.  There is a long triangular piece of matching embroidery added to the left hand side of each panel. We think this is because nakshe panels tend to become parallelogram in shape because of the diagonal stitches.  To turn these back into rectangles a long triangular section has been cut from one side and added to the other.  In other catalogue entries I've suggested similar pieces might have been done to widen the panels - please reconsider each piece because this may not always have been the reason. Each leg ends with a band of red velvet and a dark brown cord. Four pieces of plain weave green cotton have been sewn to form the crotch.  Two long triangular pieces of red/yellow plain weave silk are attached down the inner seam of each leg below the crotch. The yoke of the trousers is wide and not very deep [only 11.5 cm]; it is plain weave green cotton.  The trousers are lined with plain weave olive green cotton which folds over the top and is joined to the yoke to form a channel through which the trouser cord would have been threaded. There is a wide opening either side of the centre front and centre back. There is currently a piece of modern string threaded through.\nDescription of embroidery: there are no borders. The main pattern is a series of diagonal lines formed by applied dark brown cord running from lower right to upper left. There are three sizes of stripes:\n[1] very narrow stripes with a red ground and pink lines and light blue lines and green triangles forming a geometric meander. \n[2] wider stripes: white ground with an angular meander-like pattern formed by green and red striped stems linking a diamond-shaped red flower with blue details, a small red, blue and yellow flower and a red and pink blossom.\n[3] wider stripes: dark brown ground with a spray of 3 yellow and white flowers pointing upwards alternating with a large diagonal red flower and 2 buds pointing to the upper left.\nThreads: silk; 2S; red, pink, blue, light blue, yellow, white, dark green, dark brown, green.",
