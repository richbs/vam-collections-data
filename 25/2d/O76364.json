However, they are of solid ivory, embellished with gilding, rather than wood.  Such furniture was made in Murshidabad, the nawabi capital of Bengal, which was a renowned centre of ivory carving. William Pitt, 1st Earl Amherst of Arracan, acquired these pieces in India, where he was Governor-General from 1823 to 1828.  According to tradition he purchased them from his predecessor Frances, 1st Marquess Hastings.",
