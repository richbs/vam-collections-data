At least four Patanazzi family members, Antonio, Alfonso, Francesco and Vincenzo were potters.\nIn the middle band of decoration, the ewer bears the coat of arms of the Bavaria family of Munich. It was part of a service given by Francesco Maria II della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, to Duke Wilhelm V of Bavaria in 1586-87. A first \u2018diplomatic\u2019 maiolica set was sent to William after his visit to Urbino in 1585. The Duke and Duchess let their appreciation be known to the Duke of Urbino and a second gift of a much larger set, comprising of 272 parts, soon followed in 1587.",

It was part of a service given by Francesco Maria II della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, to Duke Wilhelm V of Bavaria in 1586-87.\nA first \u2018diplomatic\u2019 maiolica set was sent to William after his visit to Urbino in 1585. The Duke and Duchess let their appreciation be known to the Duke of Urbino and a second gift of a much larger set, comprising of 272 parts, soon followed in 1587.\nOther pieces which could be attributed to this set are a jar in the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum in Munich and another one in a Bavarian private collection.",

At least four Patanazzi family members, Antonio, Alfonso, Francesco and Vincenzo were potters. Their refined style of decoration often incorporates elaborate grotesques on a white ground. This type of painted grotesque decorations seems to have been used on Urbino maiolica from about 1560, first in the workshop of Orazio Fontana. The Patanazzi family were connected by marriage with the Fontana's and succeeded their business.",
