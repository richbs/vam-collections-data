She wrote the majority of the twenty-three Original Peter Rabbit Books between 1901 and 1913. The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.\n\nRupert Potter was a major influence on his daughter's artistic development from an early age. In the 1860s he had become fascinated by the new art of photography. He was elected a member of the Photographic Society of London and exhibited regularly at annual exhibitions.  During the Potter family's long summer holidays in Scotland and the Lake District it was Beatrix's delight to accompany her father on photographic expeditions. Happy to be by his side and excited by the possibilities of the new art form, she became his favourite and most forbearing subject and later became an avid photographer herself, inheriting one of her father\u2019s old cameras. Beatrix's watercolour drawing of daffodils is one of several border designs in the Victoria and Albert Museum specifically designed as decorative mounts for her father's photographs. Although only one has been used for this purpose, with a photograph pasted onto the design, Beatrix's border designs demonstrate her great fondness for her father and her desire to be associated with his artistic pursuits.",
