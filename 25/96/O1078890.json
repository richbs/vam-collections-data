It is interesting to note that in these illustrations, in which Pugin clearly intended to clothe the rubric in gothic forms, he includes innovations of the Reformation, such as altars with gradines and the clergy wearing birettas.\n\nThis is one of a number of preliminary designs, probably for a projected book on the ceremonies and customs of the medieval Catholic church. In 1838 the Laity's Directory advertised 'The Church of Our Fathers\u2026by Daniel Rock DD, with numerous illustrations\u2026etched by A. Welby Pugin' as a forthcoming publication. On 30 October 1837, Pugin noted in his diary 'Began Dr Rock work', therefore it is likely that these designs were intended for The Church of Our Fathers. Dr Rock took longer to write the text and the volume was finally published from 1849-1853, without Pugin's illustrations.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
