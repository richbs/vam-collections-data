Even more unusual is the fact that it is painted not only with the owner's coat of arms but with the name of the house for which it was made, Enmore Castle in Somerset, and the date, 1756 (in roman numerals). The arms are those of John Perceval, 2nd Earl of Egmont, and his wife Catherine Compton, who were married in that year. The chair must originally have been part of a set that would have been used to furnish the hall at Enmore. Hall chairs, made of solid wood and painted with the owner's arms, emerged as a new type of furniture in the 1720s. Before that, Windsor chairs had sometimes been used to furnish halls, so this Windsor hall chair combines a relatively new fashion with an older tradition.",
