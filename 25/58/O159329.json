Pots with fragrant herbs would have been used as a room freshener.\nValencia was one of the main production centres of fine lustrewares, at least from the late 15th-century onwards. The quality lustre pottery declined during the second half of the 16th century. During the 17th century, Valencian potters began to use less tin in their glaze and less silver in their lustre, resulting in strong but flat red copper lustre on a yellowish glaze.",
