The central marquetry panel bears a perspectival scene of classical architecture. Both features reflect the fashion in northern Europe in the late 1500s for Renaissance style ornament derived from classical sources. \n\nHans Vredeman de Vries (1527-1606?) was a designer, architect and painter. He worked in the southern Netherlands and throughout the Holy Roman Empire. He was an artist of many talents and published engravings of his many designs. It was through these engravings that he most influenced artists of his time. The perspectival scene on the central panel of this door is similar to designs that he published in 1560. \n\nThe Spanish burnt Antwerp Town Hall in 1576. There is evidence that de Vries worked on its reconstruction in the 1580s. The Museum purchased the door in 1856, when the Town Hall in Antwerp was being remodelled.",
