            "public_access_description": "This drawing is a design for a very fashionable teagown dated 1889. The body of the gown is crimson velvet trimmed with brown fur over an underdress of softly gathered pale pink fabric. Such gowns were worn informally at home in the late afternoon to take tea, before dressing for evening or dinner. It is one of a small group of six fashion designs dated 1889 and stamped with the Paquin archival stamp. Two of the designs are also stamped with E. Pasanisi, 24 Boulevard des Capucines. E. Pasanisi is probably the designer responsible for the designs, which may have been created for their own business or designed for sale to another fashion house. As 1889 predates the founding of the fashion house of Paquin in February 1891 by Isidore Paquin as a wedding gift for his new bride, Jeanne, these designs may have been made up by Isidore's earlier business, 'Paquin Lalanne et Cie', which was hosted at the same premises as Paquin would be, at 3 rue de la Paix. This would explain how these designs came to be in the Paquin archive. The unusual colour sensibility of this teagown is very reminscent of Jeanne Paquin's own distinctive eye for brave and unexpected colour combinations.",
