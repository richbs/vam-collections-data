They may have been made as models for figures on a tomb.\n\nDelvaux was trained in Antwerp under Pieter-Denis Plumier, with whom he was later to work in London alongside Peter Scheemakers on the monument of John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham in Westminster Abbey. Delvaux and Scheemakers went into partnership and executed monuments and some garden figures. In 1728 they lefty London for Rome where he remained until 1732, before returning to the Netherlands. While in Rome he executed a number of commissions for Italian and British patrons including John Russell 4th Duke of Bedford, who commissioned a number of works inspired by antique sculpture. He was appointed court sculptor in Brussels in 1733, and in 1734 settled in Nivelles where his workshop produced many religious works, including the monumental pulpit at St Bavo, Ghent. After 1750 he was employed by Charles of Lorraine (1712-1780), Governor of the Netherlands, to produce decorative work for his residences in Brussels, Tervuren and Mariemont.",

A putto with cornucopia of flowers, similarly signed in monogram, is illustrated by Willame in his monograph on Delvaux. Similar putti signed L.D., and an unsigned figure of the <i>Infant Hercules</i> attributed to Delvaux, were included in a sale at Christie's, London, 8 December 1992, lots 59 to 61. Jacobs has noted the similarity between such figures and the putti adorning funerary monuments executed by the Delvaux and Scheemakers partnership, particularly that to Dr Hugh Chamberlen of c. 1730-2 in Westminster Abbey, suggesting an approximate date for the terracottas. Malcolm Baker has however recently suggested that this present piece and its pendant might be later in date.",
