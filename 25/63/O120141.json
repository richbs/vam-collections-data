The earliest datable figures appear to be of Queen Victoria, and although a few figures were produced after her death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905.  During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints.  They represented a wide variety of subjects but those of actors and actresses were especially popular.\n\nThis figurine represents Mother Goose, the subject of the fairy tale which appeared in a French collection published by Charles Perrault and translated into English in 1729.  This may have been made because the fairy tale was a generally popular subject, or because of a theatrical production.  Much earlier in the 19th century the clown Grimaldi had made his name in the Covent Garden production of Dibdin's pantomime Mother Goose, or, the Golden Egg.",
