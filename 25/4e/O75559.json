Bronze paint now covering the gilded areas. At the top, two putti support a shield carved with the Hildyard family coat of arms,' azure, three mullets or'. At the base, a giltwood laurel wreath frames a cypher, which could possibly represent the letters CH for Christopher Hildyard. The laurel wreath is surmounted by a giltwood bow, the ribbons entwine round the base of the wreath and end in tassels forming an apron flanking acanthus scrolls. Similar giltwood tassels emerge from behind the armorial shield at the top. Set within the frame is a mirror glass that appears to be 18th century. The loose nature of the fittings to hold the glass suggest that this glass was not original to the frame. The wall-hanging device on the reverse at the top consists of an angled band of wood, pierced to hang over a nail.",

The elaborate carved frame with a coat of arms and entwined initials demonstrates its owner's high status. In 1667 Christopher Hildyard (1640-1685) married Esther Dobson, a daughter of William Dobson (died 1666), a Hull merchant and Lord Mayor. The winged cherubs and tied ribbons suggest that the frame may have been made to commemorate the marriage. The carved monogram could represent CH for Christopher Hildyard. Both frames now contain mirror glass, but they may once have held small painted portraits. In the 1600s both mirrors and family portraits were status symbols. Rich frames were considered appropriate for them. At a later date the frame was painted black to imitate ebony. This probably covers what were painted surfaces. Bronze paint now covers areas that would have been gilded originally.",
