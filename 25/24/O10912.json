            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nA teapot and lamp-stand, used to warm and serve tea. The wooden handle, finials and feet act as insulators against the heat.\n\nUse\nThe 'lamp' (the burner) would be filled with spirit and lit to keep the contents of the pot warm. The placement of the spout at right-angles to the pot's handle was not uncommon in the early 18th century, and may have been an adaption for use on small tables. Teapots do not often survive complete with their lamp-stands.\n\nDesign\nPear-shaped teapots were a standard feature of English silver from the late 17th century, and remained the dominant form until the late 1720s. They are generally quite plain, which makes the applied leaves on the domed cover of this example quite unusual. Simon Pantin (born about 1680; died 1728), the maker of this set, was a leading Huguenot silversmith working in London, and the applied leaf decoration may reflect something of the Huguenot stylistic influence.",
