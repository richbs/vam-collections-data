He steps from the tomb onto the body of a moustachioed soldier, who wears a pointed basinet and tippet, a low-belted jupon, gauntlets and armour. He lies against a raised piece of ground on the left of the panel in front of the tombm and holds in his right hand the blade of the battle-axe which lies on the ground beside him. A soldier similar to the first, but wearing a wide-sleeved short tunic, is seated asleep on a mound at the end of the tomb on the right, leaning on his axe. \n\nThe top of the panel has a embattled canopy, a feature popular in the early 15th century.  This feature links it to four other panels in the V&A (A.152-1946, A.154-1946, A.171-1946, A.172-1946) which must originally have formed an altarpiece showing scenes from Christ's Passion.  This altarpiece was originally in the old oratory of the church of the Holy Sepulchre in Palma de Mallorca.",
