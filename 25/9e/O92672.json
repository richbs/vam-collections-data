Each portrait is accompanied by notes by Francis Wyndham. Together, they constitute a celebration of the growing celebrity culture of the Sixties, and many of them have become the definitive images of key figures of cultural life in London during the Swinging Sixties.\nSurprisingly, only four of the pin-ups are women, all of whom are models; as the notes explain, 'in the age of Mick Jagger, it is the boys who are the pin-ups'. Here Jagger poses with Max Maxwell, art director for Queen magazine.",
