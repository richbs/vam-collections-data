Rigo &Co, a printing house which was active in the early to mid nineteenth century. Text at the top of the print indicates that it was part of a series of prints entitled 'Gallerie Dramatique' and connected with productions at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Op\u00e9ra. \n\nLe Diable \u00e0 Quatre or 'The Devil to Pay' has been both a comic opera and a ballet. This costume seems more likely to come from the ballet which was first presented by the Ballet of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique on August 11, 1845. The Principal dancers in this performance were Carlotta Grisi (as Mazourka) and Lucien Petipa (as Count Polinski). \n\nThe costume is question is associated with the 'Cracovienne' a Polish Folk Dance which featured in many ballets during this period and was favoured by the Romantic ballerina, Fanny Elssler. On the heels of the dancer in the print are little spurs, which would have provided a metallic click in the rhythm of the dance.",
