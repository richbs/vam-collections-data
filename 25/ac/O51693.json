They acted as reminders to the living of their own mortality and were often handed down through later generations as heirlooms. The folding panels in this example emphasise the intimate nature of the object.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe panels include several references to the passing of time and the fragility of life, as well as the events of marriage and death.  On the left exterior panel are figures representing youth and age. On the right are two inscriptions, each  incorporating a visual pun or 'rebus',  in which a picture or figure represents a name, word or phrase. Here Christ is represented by a painted figure and the clock dial completes the inscription 'We Must' by representing the words 'Die All'.\n\nDress\nHenry and Dorothy Holme are dressed in the style of the well-to-do merchant class rather than the height of fashion.  While their garments are quite plain they could clearly afford the luxury of lace accessories.  Henry's ruff and cuffs are trimmed with fine imported needle lace.  His wife's are trimmed with bobbin lace of a typically English pattern.  Broad-brimmed beaver hats, such as Dorothy wears, were popular with country gentlewomen and women of the merchant class.\n\nCostume provides a clue to the sex of the children in this portrait.  Boys up to the age of about 7 were dressed like little girls, wearing skirts known as petticoats.  To differentiate them from girls the bodice part of their costume took the form of a man's doublet.  Little girls typically wore an embroidered cap, or 'coif', and an apron with a bib.  Long narrow strips of fabric known as leading strings are attached to both the children's sleeves.  These were used to guide children as they learned to walk.",

The couple are depicted solemnizing their marriage vows on a book of prayer.  A skull beside the wife's portrait presumably indicates that the panel was painted after her death, unless it was a later addition.  In a domestic setting, portraits of the deceased acted on the living as reminders of their own mortality. The coats of arms above the man's head are unidentified, but those of his wife are of Holme of Paul Holme quartering Wastney. The couple are not dressed in the height of fashion but in the style of the well-to-do merchant class.
