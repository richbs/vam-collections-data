She models the main shape in wax, often incorporating found objects such as pine cones, rubber balls or ears of corn which help to give the object its shape. She then casts the form in glass and finishes it by polishing, but also by roughening part of the surface with hammer and chisel. The polished surfaces provide a window into the interior of the shape which is accentuated by the roughened exterior.\n\nLene B\u00f8dker had her first big solo exhibition in the Ebeltoft Glassmuseum in 2007-2008 and 'Resting' was one of the works shown there.
