His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nChristopher Fry\u2019s verse play The Dark is Light Enough (1954) is set in the Countess Rosmarin Ostenburg\u2019s country house at the time of the Hungarian rebellion against the Austrians, 1848-1850.  The dying Countess with pacifist principles selflessly harbours Gettner, her former son-in-law and deserter from the Hungarian army.  The play received mixed reviews following its transference to Broadway, New York in 1955.  Critics praised the acting and sets but objected to the play\u2019s obscure meaning.\n\nMessel's first step in stage design was to create a set story board.  The top sketch shows the Countess\u2019s lavish drawing room, the setting for Acts I and III. The staircase on the left is a key part of the final scene, when the Countess descends the staircase majestically for the last time.   The sketch below shows the setting for Act II: Gettner hides from Hungarian soldiers in the Countess\u2019s stables.",
