Ring brooches can be circular or heart-shaped, and their design dates from the Middle Ages.  They differ from modern brooches in the way they fasten.  The wearer pulls the cloth of the garment through the central hole, and then spears it with the pin.  The greater the strain on the pin, the more secure the fastening.  Ring brooches were worn throughout Norway in the 18th and 19th century.  Their shape and pattern varied by district and use.  They were worn by men, women, and children.\n\nThere are well over 50 different names for brooches in Norwegian.  Each kind of brooch has its own distinctive name, some of which date back to the Middle Ages.  \n  \nA hjartesprette is a small heart-shaped ring brooch. The word sprette is used for small ring brooches of all kinds, particularly in Setesdal and Telemark. \n\nHeart-shaped brooches were common throughout Europe in the Middle Ages, and survived with traditional costume in many countries into the 19th century.  In Norway they were worn by both men and women, and were frequently given as love tokens.  A heart has the same meaning everywhere.  They are usually topped with a crown, or two birds facing each other, also a symbol of love.  In Norway, heart brooches mainly come from the north of the country.",
