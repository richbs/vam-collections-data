It was made in the workshops of Pierre-Phuilippe Thomire in 1788 and it shows superlative craftsmanship in the intricate modelling and matt and burnished gilding. The firegrate is interesting because of its signature, dating and quality of execution, but it is unique in that it was made to an English commission and to a specifically English design. The English coal-burning grate was unfamiliar in France where they continued to burn wood.\nIt was probably supplied to the London dealer John Linnell who had connections with the mercier Daguerre in Paris. Linnell was furnishing Uxbridge House in 1788 and this firegrate, decorated with emblems of music, lyres and trumpets, may have been originally  intended for the music-room there."

The grate was originally commissioned through the London cabinet maker John Linnell for Uxbridge House, London, but later acquired for Powderham Castle, designed by the architect James Wyatt in the mid-1790s for the 3rd Viscount Courtenay. The grate was once framed by the marble caryatid chimney piece in the Music Room at Powderham, which was made by the English sculptor Richard Westmacott to Wyatt's designs. An inventory at Powderham, compiled in 1803, suggest however, that the grate may have been first shown in the library. It is in remarkable condition, retaining its original gilded surface, and show no signs of use as a fire grate.",

It was probably originally commissioned for Uxbridge House, London, by the cabinet-maker John Linnell through the Paris marchand mercier Dominique Daguerre who subcontracted it to the leading bronzier Pierre-Philippe Thomire. Recorded at Powderham in the early 19th century, it was sold at Christie's, London in 1987 and acquired by the V&A with contributions from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the National Art Collections Fund (Art Fund).\n\nHistorical significance: Mark Girouard wrote about the Music Room in his articles on Powderham for Country Life Magazine and noted 'As a signed piece in an English home dating from (Thomire's) early and more personal period, the grate at Powderham is, I think, unique'. (Country Life, 18th July 1963)\n\nAn article published by Jenny Saunt in the Journal of the Antique Metalware Society (Vol. 18, June 2010: see References) illustrates an inventory at Powderham, compiled in 1803, suggesting that the grate may have been first shown in the library.",

This particular drawing is associated with Linnell's important commission to furnish and decorate Uxbridge House, London, 1785-88. The drawing bears the inscription 'Echelle de quatre Pieds d'Angleterre', is executed in a finer hand than the other drawings in this collection and is on continental paper. The drawing may be in Thomire's hand and if so, may have been executed through the agency in Paris of the marchand mercier Dominique Daguerre. The two other related drawings of grates may be English variants of the French original. The rough pencil sketch (E.330-1929) shows the possible arrangement of the grate with the columns standing in recesses on either side of the chinney-piece rather than as supports to the grate itself as shown in (E.370-1929). For a discussion of these drawings see Helena Hayward and Pat Kirkham, <u>William and John Linnell</u>, 1980.",

The Courtenay family archives list payments for the Music Room from March 1794 to April 1796. The Thomire fire grate was probably acquired for the room as the musical motifs and figures of Apollo and Euterpe provided such an appropriate focus for the hearth.",
