Fife, an art master, as a teaching aid for students.\n\nOwnership & Use\nDuring the 19th century a number of studies were made on the relationship of colour and light, by  both scientists and artists. Generally these took the form of colour wheels of primary colours. This colour diagram, however, was conceived to demonstrate not colour theory but the practical application of watercolour pigments and the effects of superimposed washes. It has the basic colours of the watercolour painting set: chrome yellow (1), raw sienna (2), cobalt blue (3), light red (4), ultramarine (5), rose madder (6), brown ochre (7) and China ink wash (8). It was therefore published by Lyon A. Fife as an aid for a wide range of students, and was not designed specifically for the Schools of Design.",
