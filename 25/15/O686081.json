(1843-1927) continued\n\nA sketch and studies (11 on 10 sheets) for illustrations to Dicken's [sic]\n<u>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</u> published in six parts, April to\nSeptember, 1870 and as a volume, 1870, by Chapman and Hall, London.\n<u>E.781 inscribed with colour notes and E.788 with a note on its \nengraved size 2 1/4 high.\nPencil,   black and red chalk,   pen and ink,   heightened and corrected\nwith white.</u>   <u>E.785 squared for reduction.</u>   <u>Various sizes.</u>\n                                                                                                E.781-790\u20131971\n\nBequeathed by Sir Paul Fildes O. B. E., F. R. S. in memory of his \nfather, the Artist\n[...]\n\nStudies (2 on 1 sheet) for Rosa Bud, including a detail of\n her head, and Helena Landless in 'At the piano',\nillustration facing page 44, first published in part 2, May\n1870.   (P. F. 108a)                                    E.784-1971\"\n[...]\n\n<u>Note</u>:   Dickens invited Fildes to illustrate <u>Edwin Drood</u> on Millais'\nsuggestion, after ill-health forced C. A. Collins to give up\nthe commission.   There is a letter in the library from \nDickens to Frederic Chapman, the publisher, dated 18\nJanuary1870, asking him to arrange for Fildes to call and \nsee him.   There is also a jubilant letter dated 17 January\n1870 from Fildes to Harry Woods telling him of the \ncommission.\n\nThese studies, with the exception of that of Rosa Bud for \n'Jasper's sacrifices' E.790-1971 are in the same sense as the\nprinted illustrations.   The finished designs were photographed\non the block, thus they were not destroyed in the process.\nPhotographes of each of these, some in reverse, were found \namongst the artist's papers, and are mounted with the \nproofs of the wood-engravings, E. 917-923\u20131971.   The artist\nsold the originals in the U. S. A. and a large number of\nstudies were similarly disposed of by the Executors' of the\nartist's estate in 1928.   The studies in this collection came to light subsequently.\n\nE.788-1971 is a view of Fulham Church and the wooden \nbridge which used to span the Thames at that point.\n\nA complete set of the parts and two copies of the book are\nin the Department of Prints and Drawings, E. 972 and 973, \n974\u20131971.
