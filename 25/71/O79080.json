The sturdy construction and leather covers would have withstood regular use, possibly as a dining chair.  The seat is strengthened by a plain, square-section back and side stretchers, the lower ones at floor level.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe leather seat cover, which is much worn and repaired, shows traces of stitching in an oval shape. This is evidence that the seat originally had stitching to hold the stuffing in place, withleather buttons securing the thread. Tack marks in the back of the chair show that the leather was at one time covered by later upholstery.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis kind of chair was called a 'back stool' - literally, a stool with a back attached. It was the standard type from 1615 until about 1670, when fashionable chair-backs became higher and the back legs were raked backwards for greater stability. This chair is raked above seat level but the back legs are vertical.\n\nRepairs\nThere is a modern oak panel fixed beneath the seat to hold the stuffing in place. The back corners of the chair seat are supported by metal straps.",
