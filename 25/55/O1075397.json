Full Citation: \n \n\"<b>42 Katherine Bruce, Mrs Dysart</b> \n(d. 1649) \n<b>1649</b> \nHH2-1979  \n \n<b>Rectangular 253 X 206 mm, the vellum pieced out by 16 mm in the lower margin</b> \n \nFeatures stippled in blue and grey, with some yellow/brown and white heightening in the eyes, on a pale carnation ground; hair in long strokes of brown wash hatched and stippled with brown, yellow and grey-blue over the carnation; pearls in blue-grey with gummy white highlights; costume in blue wash stippled with darker colour and grey, and with some gouache heightening; chemise modelled in grey over white; foliage in transparent washes stippled with darker colour; other landscape elements in wash stippled with transparent and opaque colours; on vellum put down on pasteboard. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Very faded overall, except for a protected marginal strip at the top where some indication of the original green foliage is preserved; the features have presumably lost most of the brown and sanguine modelling.  \n \n<b>Signed:</b> In black lower left: <i>Alex:Marshal</i>. Signed and <b>inscribed</b> again on the back in ink: <i>Alex: Marshal. Fecit/ 1649/ La ditte -. mourut Le 2 \u00e8me daoust/ 1649/ / /</i>. \n \n<b>Frame:</b> When acquired, a dealer's gilded wooden frame of perhaps c.1900, now replaced for display at Ham with a brown stained wooden frame, originally fitted out by the Museum in 1894 to show <i>The Pocket Book</i> (see S Cooper, Cat. No. 87 [460-1892]), and since cut down.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> According to MS notes by C F Bell in his copy of Long 1929, this and a companion piece, a portrait of Charles II after Hanneman, were from the sale of the possessions of Viscount Ashbrook and had been at Castle Durrow in Kilkenny; they were bought by a London dealer and sold c.1922 to Andrew Mackay (the cataloguer of the Buccleuch Collection) who had them photographed; thence apparently by descent, until bought for the Museum, Christie's 27 November 1979, lot 70.  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Long 1929, p. 289 (as 'reversed'); Croft-Murray and Hulton 1960, vol. I, p.441; Foskett 1972, vol. I, p. 399; <i>Ham House</i>, 1973, pp. 61-2, pl. 30; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 37; Jane Roberts in Fisher 1985, pp. 9-10, 14 and repro. p. 10. \n\nA close copy, but with the background altered, of the Hoskins portrait, Cat. No. 27. [HH.274-1948]\n\nThe landscape background shows the north front of Ham House before the major alterations carried out by Elizabeth Dysart after her second marriage to the Earl (subsequently Duke) of Lauderdale in February 1671/2. Marshal's presence at the house suggests that Elizabeth's mother, the subject of this portrait, and her husband William Murray, subsequently Earl of Dysart, may have been actively improving the gardens at Ham during the late 1640s by importing specimen plants. Marshal according to Samuel Hartlib (1) was still resident at Ham in 1650 'with a whole chamber of insects which make a glorious representation'. \n\n1 Quoted by Jane Roberts in Fisher 1985, p. 10.\"",
