The following is the full text of the entry: BENEFIAL, MARCO (1684-1764) 928 Self-portrait at the age of forty-seven years and one month; in an oval frame Inscribed in ink within a cartouche \u2018Aeques Marcus Benefial annorum quadraginta septum mensis que unius\u2019 Red and black chalk 13 \u00bc x 8 \u00bd (336 x 216) D.1927-1889 LITERATURE A. M. Clark, \u2018Manners and methods of Benefial\u2019 in <i>Paragone</i>, 17, no. 199, 1966, p. 32, n. 6 (described as a self-portrait) The portrait bears some resemblance to the portraits of artists made for Nicola Pio (see Anthony Clark in <i>Master Drawings</i>, 5, 1967, pp. 3-23). But as Clark points out, the drawing was made in 1731 (if the inscription is correct), and that is at least seven years too late for it to be one of the Pio illustrations. Benefial\u2019s painted self-portrait in the Accademia di S. Luca, Rome, is illustrated in F. Sapori\u2019s article on him in Rassegna d\u2019Arte, 19, 1919, p. 70. It was presumably painted after 1755, when he became a member of the Accademia, and it thus shows an older man: but he appears to be the same man.",
