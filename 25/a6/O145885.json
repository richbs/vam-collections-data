The cover over the blade incorporates a fine mesh foil; the end sections are ridged to facilitate removal while the sides are trapezoid sections covering the shaving head and motor housing. The shaving head is a horizontal steel bar with a row of semi circular cutting blades, attached to a nylon bracket which oscillates rapidly when the motor is switched on. The head is completely detachable for easy cleaning. The spindle supporting it is covered by a rubber grommet. The on/off switch is a thin strip of plastic on the front panel of the body and moves vertically. The base is a curved quadrant, It opens by being moved to one side and then outwards to reveal the battery compartment which contains two AA 1.5 volt batteries. The cap follows the same contours as the body. On either side are extended arms which fit into a groove on either side of the battery housing, the main part of the body. A detachable brush for cleaning is incorporated into the top of the cap.",
