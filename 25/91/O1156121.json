He wears a deep red jacket over this tunic which is trimmed with metallic gold motifs at the front fastenings and sleeve edges. He wears a small crimson cap with a tassel and gold sandals over pink metallic stockings. \n\nTinsel prints were created from etched portraits of theatrical stars in popular roles they played on the London stage. They were hand-painted in watercolour and decorated with scraps of material and tinsel additions. They were popular during the first half of the 19th century and were considered an adult, rather than a child's hobby. By the 1830s it was possible to buy the tinsel, leather and feather ornaments to go with each image.",
