Until the 1920s the firm\u2019s major commissions were for ecclesiastical and domestic objects, but from the early 1930s onwards they increasingly specialised in civic plate, including cups and trophies.\n\nBetween 1914 and 1945 the silver trade in Birmingham slumped due to the demands of war and the impact of economic depression. During this period A. Edward Jones was notably rare in continuing to actively pursue new designs for silver; most other firms relied on making reproductions of historic pieces.",
