Another lady stands by the central couple holding a flower with her head averted as the man stretches out his left foot and places it upon one of hers.\n     This scene of dalliance is set in front of a white pavilion decorated with a scrollwork of tiny flowers. An archway opens to a chamber beyond which has a top tier of niches for ceramics either side of a trellised opening above a doorway masked by a floral chick and a rolled-up blind.  The courtyard in front of the pavilion is covered with a red carpet or floor spread with a scrolling floral design and a narrow green border on which is placed a green rug on top of which the lovers are seated.  A doorway on the left at the back opens onto a wooded landscape against a golden sky.\n      The painting is framed with a dark blue inner border ornamented with a stylised floral scroll in gold.  This frame is outlined in white lines with a further gold line, two black ruled lines at  its outer edge, and an adjacent blue line on the main border.  There is a row of pink lilies and red poppies painted on the ivory-coloured main border surrounding the central framing, the outer margins of which are painted in red over a former buff-coloured edging with a white line along its inner edge.  A strip of crimson-coloured paper has been added along the inner right hand edge of the page to act as a gutter for the present album binding.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
