In this particular photograph, the thinness of paper and dullness of albumen indicate an early example of the process dating from the 1850s to the 1860s.  It is from an album of photographs from the Victorian metalworker Francis Skidmore's (1817-1896) firm.  It is of a half pair of gates and is inscribed 'Designed and fitted by WF'.  The gates may have been made at either West Orchard or Alma Street, Coventry.  The photograph is thus a record of the work done and the letters 'fi' in the bottom left corner of the album page on which it is mounted denote the code for this design.",
