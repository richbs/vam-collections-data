Apprenticed to a publisher 1808, received a few lessons in painting from Thomas Sully. A subscription was raised to enable him to study art in Europe; returned.to London 1811, entered RA Schools and studied with Benjamin West and Washington Allston. Visited Paris 1817 with Allston and Wilkie Collins, met G S Newton, with whom he visited Brussels and Antwerp. Also friend and biographer (published 1843) of John Constable. Exhibited 76 works at the RA between 1813 and 1859, and 11 at the BI 1815-32. Some were portraits, but most were his much admired literary subjects, particularly drawn from Cervantes, Moliere, Shakespeare and Steme. Elected ARA 1821, RA 1826. Several of his works were engraved, and he made six illustrations for Sir WaIter Scott's Waverley novels 1824. Worked for six months as drawing master at West Point Military Academy, New York State, 1833. Professor of Painting at RA 1848-52; his lectures were published as a <U>Handbook for Young Painters</u> (1855). His <u>Life of Reynolds</u> was finished by Tom Taylor and published 1865. Died St John's Wood, London, 5 May 1859. An exhibition at the RA of  30 of his works was held winter 1870. His two sons, George Dunlop and Robert, were also artists. The <u>Athenaeum </u>critic (9 May 1846, p480) wrote that he was 'unrivalled for the certainty of his powers, the <i>wi</i>t of his pencil, the deep knowledge of human nature as exhibited in the more ordinary scenes of life'.\n\nLIT: <u>Art JournaI</u>1856, pp73-5 and 105-7, 1859, p187 (obit); C R Leslie <u>Autobiographical Recollections</u> ed T Taylor, 2 vols, 1860; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by C R Leslie </u> nd [1875]; <u>Art ]ournaI</u>1902, pp 144-8; J Constable <u>The Letters of John Constable and C R Leslie</u> 1931; ed R B Beckett John <u>Constable's Correspondence</u> III, Ipswich 1965 \n\n\n<b>Laura Introducing Gil Blas to Arsenia</b> \nFA120 Neg Y463 \nCanvas, 21 X 26 cm (8\u00bc X l0\u00bcins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \nThe following passage is quoted in the 1907 catalogue: \n\nElle etait dans un deshabille galant, et ses belles mains s'occupaient a preparer une coiffure nouvelle pour jouer son role ce jour-la. 'Madame', lui dit la soubrette, 'voici l'econome en question; je puis vous assurer que vous ne sauriez avoir un meilleur sujet'. Arsenic me regarda tres attentivement ... 'Comment done, Laure', s'ecria-t-elle, 'mais voila un fort joli garcon; je prevois que je m'accommoderai bien de lui'. \n\nThe lines are from Le Sage's picaresque romance <i>The Adventures of Gil Blas of Santillane,</i> first published 1715-35, book 3 chapter 9. \nThe work may well be a sketch for a larger, more finished painting . \nAlthough Le Sage is mentioned in <u>Leslie</u> as one of the artist's favourite authors, the only painting of a Gil Blas subject recorded seems to be the <i>'Gil Blas and the Duchess'</i> in the Phipps sale at Christie's 25 June 1859 (81), bought Lord Lansdowne \u00a3 144 18s \n\n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
