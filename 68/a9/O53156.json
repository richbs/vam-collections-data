He also made barometers such as this one, which dates from about 1730.  Two of his sons also followed him into the clockmaking trade. This relatively plain example is veneered in walnut and has a six-point star inlaid with various woods in the centre of the recording dial at the bottom, a feature John Hallifax often used. \n\nBarometers used to predict the weather from the 1680s, after it was noticed  that weather conditions were connected to changes in the weight or pressure of the air, which the barometer had been developed to measure for laboratory purposes. The glass-covered dial in the centre indicated the rise and fall of mercury within a glass tube, which reflected changes in air pressure.",
