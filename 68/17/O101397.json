His early work reflects the style of the artist and illustrator Charles Rickets (1866-1931). During the early twentieth century Philpot became popular as a portrait artist. Always concerned that his style would become stale he chose different poses and techniques for these works. Constantly dissatisfied with his work, Philpot travelled to different places including Paris, North Africa and Venice. The portraits that Philpot is best known for present a cross-section of early twentieth century, from his portraits of admirals during the First World War to the portraits of dancers from the Ballet Russes of the 1920s. \n\nThis pencil drawing shows the head and torso of a young woman. The figure is shown looking away from the viewer over her right shoulder. Soft pencil lines have been used to convey the sitter's delicate features and hair that flows back over her shoulders. This early drawing by the artist was possibly executed whilst he was studying at Lambeth School.",
