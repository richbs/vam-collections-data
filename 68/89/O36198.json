The horse and the rider are both cast in two halves\nalong the length and held together with tongue and slot joints. In places the rider appears to be integral but it is painted after joining and slightly affects the appearance. The rider is a Hussar painted grey; red; yellow; white and black with the arms also separately attached. In the right hand is the hilt of a sword (blade is missing). The clockwork is housed in the body covered by a metal plate cut away to allow the legs to move. The key is integral; attached underneath. When would the back legs collapse then spring open and the horse appears to leap along. It has an erratic movement. \n\n*This type of mechanical horse was developed by G\u00fcnthermann and it is probably by the maker although not marked. The horse is pre-1914.",
