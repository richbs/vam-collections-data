She called the doll 'Mrs Beasley' after a doll from a series on the television, where she remembers the girl in the series having a doll with white glasses who she was able to communicate with. Although this doll is not the official 'Mrs Beasley' doll that was part of the merchandise for the television series 'Family Affairs', which first aired in 1966, it was named after her due to her popularity. \n\nIt demonstrates the popularity of character toys, which began their rise in the 1950s when many people had access to television at home and continued to grow well in to the 1980s when toy manufacturers realised how lucrative the market was.",
