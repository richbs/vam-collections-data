In 1885 he moved to London where he spent the rest of his life. He was the teacher of Pieter Gaal (1770-1819), Andrea Scacciati II (1725-1771) and of his own daughter Katharina Wilhelmina Schweickhardt (1776-1830).\n\nThis grisaille painting of four cupids leaning over clouds and playing with festoons of flowers is a typical example Schweickhardt\u2019s decorative panels, which forms a pair with 560-1882. The artist especially favoured children and putti\u2019s subject matters for which he took his inspiration from the masters of the genre, the French Rococo painters Fran\u00e7ois Boucher and Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard. These subjects are purely decorative and recall an idyllic Arcadian world, a trend that also spread in French literature of the late 18th century.",

Victoria & Albert Museum, HMSO, London, 1990. p.xix-xx\n\nJohn Jones (1800-1882) was first in business as a tailor and army clothier in London 1825, and opened a branch in Dublin 1840.  Often visited Ireland, travelled to Europe and particularly France.  He retired in 1850, but retained an interest in his firm.  Lived quietly at 95 Piccadilly from 1865 to his death in January 1882.  After the Marquess of Hertford and his son Sir Richard Wallace, Jones was the principal collector in Britain of French 18th century fine and decorative arts.  Jones bequeathed an important collection of French 18th century furniture and porcelain to the V&A, and among the British watercolours and oil paintings he bequeathed to the V&A are subjects which reflect his interest in France.  \n\nSee also <u>South Kensington Museum Art Handbooks.

Pictures,... and other things</u>, p.138, \"The pictures which are included in the Jones bequest are, with scarcely a single exception, valuable and good; and many of them excellent works of the artists.  Mr. Jones was well pleased if he could collect enough pictures to ornament the walls of his rooms, and which would do no discredit to the extraordinary furniture and other things with which his house was filled.\"\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a good example of Netherlandish 18th-century fashionable decorative panels which developed under the influence of the French Rococo style. Often called <i>witjes</i> in reference to the leading figure in this category, Jacob de Wit (1695-1754), these pieces usually show small figures placed in a mythological and allegorical context. \nFormerly attributed to Dirk van der Aa (1731-1809), this work was reattributed to Hendrik Willem Schweickhardt by Charles Dumas (written communication, Feb. 2010), a painter who developed this type of subject adding in his grisaille technique pink and white hues, drawing thus upon the French Rococo\u2019s taste, Fran\u00e7ois Boucher (1703-1770) and Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard (1732-1806).\nThe subject matter is here difficult to identify: it may relate to an allegory of sight as the little putti are showing flowers garlands to each other while its counterpart could be an allegory of hearing with putti playing music.\nSchweickhardt usually sets his playful <i>putti</i> on clouds such as an <i>Allegory of Smell,</i> dated 1780, and <i>Allegory of taste,</i> dated 1779, Private collection, The Netherlands. \nThis style shows also a taste of the Royal court in The Hague for French Rococo decorations.",

            "historical_context_note": "Decorative paintings executed in the grisaille technique were known in the 18th-century Netherlands as <i>witjes</i> in reference to the leading figure in this category of painting, Jacob de Wit (1695-1754). These works usually imitate marble, plaster or stucco and enabled Dutch artists of that period to improve their decorations with the illusion of sculpture. These large-scale paintings originated in the Italian, French and Flemish art before the 17th century but developed in Holland during the second half of the 17th century thanks to the Flemish born painter G\u00e9rard de Lairesse (1640-1711) who was called by his contemporaries the 'Dutch Apelles' as well as the 'Dutch Poussin' and the 'Dutch Raphael'. After Lairesse's death, Jacob de Wit took over and developed this category of painting by creating grisaille paintings as overmantels (known as chimneypieces), overdoor panels, and as inserts bordering panels, which encountered a great success. Few 18th-century Dutch painters continued to create <i>witjes</i>, among whom the most eminent ones were Aert Schouman (1710-1792), Hendrik Willem Schweickhardt (1746-1797), Dirck van der Aa (1731-1809) and the brothers Abraham (1753-1826) and Jacob van Strij (1756-1815). The demand for such works of art diminished however rapidly after the middle of the century and a vogue for painted and then printed wallpaper that began at the beginning of the century also helped to change the fashion.",
