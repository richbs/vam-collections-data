Reminiscent of sumptuous Renaissance attire, this fitted jacket has full \u2018slashed\u2019 sleeves and a jaunty peplum. It is constructed from 15 panels, each with a different design and colour combination. Annie Fewlass studied fashion and textiles at Birmingham/Leicester College of Art. She often uses machine knitting as a base for various hand techniques such as crochet, beading , embroidery and felting. This jacket design, with its varied textiles and patterns, indicates how important textural surface is to the designer who often experiments with different fabrics, yarns and trimmings.",
