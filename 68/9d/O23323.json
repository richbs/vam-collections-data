The design is executed in a painted resist-dye technique - probably the 'cone drawing' resist technique known as <i>tsutsugaki</i>.\nThe jacket is simply cut in the usual Japanese style with a centre back seam and no shoulder seams. There are no inserts at the front but a long collar band extends almost to the bottom of the jacket. The collar band and the armholes are faced with undyed soft cotton which is sewn to the jacket with alternating long and short straight stitches in thick white cotton thread. These stitches have a decorative effect as they deliberately show on the right side of the garment. The armholes are open to a depth of 39 cms.\nThe jacket is unlined.",

The motifs - a samurai helmet and arrows - are associated with the Boys Festival, which takes place on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. The pattern has been created using a technique called \u2018tsutsugaki\u2019. In this method a design is drawn on the cloth with paste squeezed from a tube (tsutsu). The tube is made from paper treated with persimmon juice to make it water resistant; it has a nozzle of bamboo or metal through which the paste is extruded. The paste, made of rice flour, lime and water, forms a protective coating that prevents the colour penetrating when the cloth is dyed.",
