Down the sides and across the top is a broader border with a reversed S-shaped stem in green not quite linking a 5-petalled red flower with a green and yellow centre.  Each stem goes through a red bud and ends with a serrated leaf.  The narrow border is repeated on 3 sides. The main panel contains a lobed arch with a red roundel at the top, containing an inscription, surrounded by 4 birds. The spandrels are divided into a small diamond grid in green, each diamond contains a red pointed flower linked by a small green stem to the lattice.  The main border and the inside of the arch are quilted in a diamond pattern.  Isolated floral sprigs are placed in off-set bands inside the arch.  There is a pointed green flower with a yellow centre, red buds and a curving stem to the right with red leaves.\nThe yellow has faded from orange.",
