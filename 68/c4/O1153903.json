The image shows a winter landscape with a frozen lake in the foreground and buildings and a mountain scene visible in the distance. Groups of figures are sledging and skating across the ice, at the left hand front of the scene is a trio of dancers consisting of two women on either side of a man. The women are dressed in fur trimmed fitted jackets over full knee length skirts. They are also wearing boots trimmed with fur and caps worn at the back of their hair. Both women are leaning towards the man, one, who seems to be his original partner is trying to regain his attention as the other skates provocatively close. The man is dressed in a long, fitted jacket with wide shoulders over tight knee length breeches. He is also wearing a wide brimmed cap. He is leaning backwards, one leg crossed in front of the other, and his gaze is drifting towards this second skater and away from his distressed partner.  On the right hand side of the scene a man dressed in long jacket and top hat is pushing a sledge with three figures wrapped in fur inside it. At the centre of the scene a circle of figures are dancing hand in hand.",
