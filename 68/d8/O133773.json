In 1842, he was awarded a medal in Paris and was a member of the St Petersburg Academy.\n\nHumbert was essentially an animal painter and this work is a fine example of his output of the 1850s. The subject matter is inspired from the rustic life of the people in the Alps where he travelled with Calame and Diday. The interest in the rustic life is characteristic of the Realist movement emerged in the 1840s in France under the influence of Corot and Courbet, which spread in Europe throughout the 19th century.",

Chauncey Hare Townshend, 1868\n\nHistorical significance: Although Humbert trained in Ingres' atelier in Paris, his oeuvre is much more indebted to the Realist movement rather than the Neo-classical aesthetic developed by the master. Such animal paintings with cows and horses in bright landscapes are reminiscent of the Dutch 17th-century imagery that was revived during the first half of the century. Rosa Bonheur and her brother, Auguste-Fran\u00e7ois, produced similar compositions strongly reminiscent of Karel Dujardin's \u0153uvre (c. 1622-1678) but also resulting from the revived interest in direct observation of nature.\nSimilar compoistion by Humbert include: <i>Mountain landscape with animals</i>, Ariana  Museum, Geneva and <i>Pasture with cows and goats</i>, Mus\u00e9e Rath, Geneva.",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century Western art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists.",
