Japanese style, which spread across Europe in the late nineteenth century also prompted an altogether looser aesthetic, with an interest in organic forms, rich surface patination, and abstracted decoration.\n\nBindesb\u00f8ll was an architect and designer who worked across different media, from furniture to book-binding, but from 1880  to 1906 he developed a particular interest in ceramics which helped hime to hone his distinctive style. Like many designers, Bindesb\u00f8ll usually instructed professional potters in the actual potting, after which he would decorate the wet clay himself, and apply the glaze. In the case of this dish the manufacturing was undertaken by K\u00f8benhavns Lervarefabrik. It has been hand decorated but Bindesb\u00f8ll also produced designs for mass production.",
