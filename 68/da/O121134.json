They are polygonal framing a cross that meets in a central rectangle.  Within the rectangle is a cross, horned on both sides on a red or dark red ground.  The crosses are dark blue and white, with one exception.  The four quarters of the gul are light red and blue or light red and white with 3 buds on a single stalk growing out of the central rectangle.  The gul outline is a sequence of brown, red, dark blue and brown.  Offset between the guls are bands of diamonds totally filled with 9 flowerheads in all colours except brown.  Along both sides at the edge of the field is a border with a red and dark red ground on which are dark blue and light red Y-shapes on the diagonal divided by 3 white florets and a white double x-motif.\n\nMain border: red ground with a central line on which are small stepped lozenges; along the left hand side both line and lozenges are in a sequence of 3 blue or green and 1 brown; on the right hand side and the top and bottom the colours tend to alternate.  To either side of the central line there are outwardly facing pairs of stepped Y-motifs, principally in dark blue, white and very light brown with some in green.\n\nInner and outer borders: brown ground with rosettes in dark red, red, light red, blue and white with contrasting centres.\n\nOutermost border: reciprocal triangles in brown and very light brown outlined in red.",
