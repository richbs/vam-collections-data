The design shows a Chinese lady and gentleman in a rural setting surrounded by a shell shape, flower garlands and an unfinished design of a cherub's head.\n\nTime\nWhen this paper was produced, in the early part of the 18th century, the recurring fashion for Chinese design was at its height. Objects made in China as well as those made in Europe 'in the Chinese manner' were mixed together in the same room settings.\n\nTrade\nAlthough Chinese wallpapers exist in large numbers in houses in Britain, the trade in these objects remained marginal in commercial terms. The East India Company, which dominated the trade with Asia at this time, were exempted from paying taxes on papers imported into Britain. As a result they do not bear the all-important tax stamp that would allow for more accurate dating.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThis wallpaper panel has a European air about it. The border design shows no trace of Chinese imagery and even the couple in the centre are in an idealised Chinese landscape and wear clothes that only approximate what Chinese people would have worn at the time. Although such Chinese export wallpapers were made specifically for the European market, this one is unusual in using European motifs.",

Cantonese, c.1730-40. \n<i>Pen and ink, water- and body-colour.</i>           E.51-1968 \n\nGiven by the late Sir John Hampden-Mercer-Henderson, 8th Earl of Buckinghamshire \n\n<i>Note:</i> The decorative motifs of the cartouche are derived from a design by Watteau, c.1710-20, engraved by Gabriel Huquier and published with three similar designs in a set of four plates.  c.1730 (D. & V. 228-231; Berlin 11, no.274).  Copies of the set were made by Thomas Kitchen, published under the title 'The Diversions of Children'.  The Chinese inscription over a gateway in the central scene may be translated as 'The Place of the Valley of Deception [Error of Illusion].'  The fragments have been laid down on a sheet of paper mounted on canvas, and some missing parts of the design have been indicated.
