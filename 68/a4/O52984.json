            "public_access_description": "Folio stands were used to hold large portfolios of drawings, prints or watercolours and the sides of the stands were adjustable to allow the portfolios to be opened to different angles. This one may have been designed by the architect, S.S. Teulon for his first major house commission, Tortworth Court, Gloucestershire, built in the Gothic Revival style for the 2nd Earl of Ducie between 1849 and 1853. The stand is carved with the initials D and ST, possibly those of the owner and architect, in the centre of the Gothic quatrefoils while naturalistic squirrels and oak leaves decorate the frame. It may have been part of the furnishing of the library, one of three main reception rooms on the ground floor at Tortworth Court.",
