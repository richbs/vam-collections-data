The design is coupled with a type-written description of the dress, detailing its material, available colours, size suitability, and price (E.483:8-2005). The design was available in black, white and any special shade to order, and it was to be made in matt rayon crepe (a lightweight fabric characterised by a crinkled surface) French jersey. \n\nThe striking design and silhouette can also be seen in E.480-2005, a pencil drawing showing a woman in an almost identical pose. This drawing probably represents an earlier stage in the design process for the same dress, and the final work could have been traced from it. It shows contrasting piping along the neck and waistlines which is no longer present in the final design, and the fall of the band of material from the waist is also different. A smaller pencil sketch to the right shows the back of the dress. It would have been used as a presentation drawing and forms part of an album of 12 designs with accompanying descriptions from which the client could choose what she wanted to have made.",
