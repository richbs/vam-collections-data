            "public_access_description": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-91) was a child prodigy who composed from an early age. The techniques he developed in writing for opera, where the music has to convey drama and character, fed into his later orchestral music. Although Mozart was writing in the 18th Century, the first fully unadulterated performances of many of his works were not on the London stage until the early 19th Century. His increased popularity at this time led to the reproduction of this print, from an unknown French source.\n\nMozart prefered the Latin spelling of his name, hence he is most popularly known as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. His initials on this print are from the original Germanic version of his name: Johann Chrisostomos Wolfgang Theophilos Mozart.",
