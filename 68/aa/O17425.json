The use of coloured inlays is very unusual in British silver, as hallmarking regulations only permit inlays of gold. The Japanese fondness for depicting the natural world has influenced the decoration of the plate with its stylised insects and plants.\n\n Time\nThe influence of Japanese art on western goods was particularly strong in the late 19th century after Japan ended its self-imposed isolation that had lasted for nearly 200 years. Exhibitions of Japanese art caused a sensation in London in 1862 and in Paris in 1867. As in the decoration of this plate, the West borrowed heavily from the wide range of techniques and styles used by Japanese artists and craftsmen, which were then re-interpreted for a western market.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis plate, made by the London firm of Daniel and Charles Houle, has been decorated in two coloured gold inlay in imitation of Japanese sword-mount making techniques. The Houles not only copied Japanese styles and techniques but sent some of their work to Japan for decoration there.",

The hallmarking laws made such effects very difficult, as the only metal permitted to be inlayed into silver was gold. Because of the more relaxed hallmarking laws, it was American firms like Tiffany that experimented most with this kind of decoration. The influence of Japanese metalwork, which often alloyed precious and non-precious metals for effect, is visible on this piece. The Houle firm seem to have sent some work to Japan for decoration there. This piece, however, is an imitation of Japanese techniques.\n\nNeg._No: HE 2143\nHE 1802",
