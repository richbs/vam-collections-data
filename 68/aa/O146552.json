            "public_access_description": "Ayla, a site now in Jordan, near the head of the Gulf of Aqaba, was originally a Roman settlement. It was taken by the Muslims from Byzantine control. During the 12th century, Crusaders captured Ayla from the Muslims and Baldwin I of Jerusalem built a castle on Gazirat Faraun [Pharaoh\u2019s Island] nearby in about 1115. When Saladin recaptured Aqaba in 1182, the castle became known as Saladin\u2019s Castle. The fortifications were rebuilt by the Mamluk Sultan, Qansweh El-Ghuri (1501-1516) and then it came under Ottoman control. \nAlthough Maria Harriett Matthias is categorised as an amateur artist, yet, as with many other so-called amateurs, this description does not do justice to her skill as a water colourist. Very little is known about her life or work, simply because she was a woman, and did not need to sell or exhibit her paintings. Typically, she is only recorded (in Burke\u2019s Landed Gentry), because she married James Mathias (b.1823) of Catisfield Lodge, Fareham, Hampshire.  According to a fragment of her diary, in 1856-7 Maria, with her husband and `Eddy\u2019 (probably her brother-in-law, Edward Mathias), toured through Italy to Egypt and on through Syria, Palestine and Lebanon.  Paintings or drawings of this particular castle are very rare, surprisingly so, given its architecture, location and history. This watercolour was part of an album of views, mainly of Egypt, made by Maria on her tour.",
