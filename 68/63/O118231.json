            "public_access_description": "This is one of several wax figurines executed by Agatha Walker in the 1920s, mostly of actors and actresses in character in successful London stage productions. The 19th century saw a craze for ceramic figurines of performers and Agatha Walker attempted to revive this tradition with her limited edition sculptures, modelled from life in plaster and coated with a fine layer of wax which was then coloured.  In 1931 Agatha Walker's wax figures were exhibited at the Fine Art Society.\n\nThis represents the actress and singer Violet Marquesita as Lucy Lockit in John Gay's The Beggar's Opera which opened at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith on 5 June 1920. It was one of a set of characters from the opera produced by Agatha Walker in 1921. This revival of the 18th century operetta ran for  three years and was revived in 1926, 1928 and 1929 at the Lyric Theatre, with the soprano Violet Marquesita again playing Lucy Lockit. The Beggar's Opera was a great success for the theatre's owner Sir Nigel Playfair who had purchased the lease of the derelict theatre building in 1918 in a syndicate.  He transformed it into a highly successful venue, putting Hammersmith firmly on the theatrical map.",

VIOLET MARQUESITA. (Aeolian, Oct. 27) presented a remarkable assortment of the ''component parts of an artist\" without, however, causing them to cohere into an wholly convincing composition. She began with \"Wraggle Taggle Gipsies,\" a sort of version of the \"Flight of the Duchess.\"' She has a good voice, pleasing use of the throat, her gestures were exaggerated, contrasts too violent to be effective, but she has a true capacity for the tragic, and as hardly anyone else has this capacity, it is too precious to be let pass without strict critical comment. In the second song there were fine odd moments- One could have made a good series of photographs of the various poses, but the thing was not grasped as a whole, and did not carry conviction. She does not understand scale; she does not know that certain things which carry in a drawing-room will not carry in a hall.",
