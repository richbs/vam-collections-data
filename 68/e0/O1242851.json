It was evidently made for someone of importance and intended to be housed in a room of suitable proportions such as would only be found in the house of the wealthy [...].'\n\n'At Christmas, 1839, the Great Bed figured in the pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, entitled <i>Harlequin and the Merrie devil of Edmonton</i> or <i>The Great Bed of Ware</i>. For a foundation of this pantomime Mr. H. Younge selected a quaint seventeenth century tale, <i>The Life and Death of the Merrie Devil of Edmonton,</i> written by T.B., and published in 1631, and embroidered it very fancifully, as is ever the custom in pantomime, introducing quite imaginary incidents connected with the Great Bed [...].'\n\n'In the Enthoven Collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum are a series of pencil sketches of the stage settings of the various scenes of the pantomime. That of scene vi shows a large bed quite different in its ornament from the Great Bed, and with 1463 on its footboards. These sketches are by Henry Scharf, made when he was only seventeen years old. He was a brother of Sir George Scharf F.S.A., who was Director of the National Portrait Gallery for many years.' \n\nThe above historical notes are taken from a small brochure produced when The Great Bed of Ware was exhibited at Frank Partridge &amp; Sons Ltd., 26 King Street, St. James, London, S.W.1; credit for this information is given to Mr Herbert C. Andrews. A copy of the brochure is housed in the V&amp;A Theatre and Performance department, Covent Garden Theatre production file, December 1839.",
