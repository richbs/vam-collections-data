To enhance business, photographers strove for innovation and novelty. \n\nOne short-lived example of this is the 'Crystal Cube Miniature', invented by Henry Swan. When viewed through mirrors and prisms the hand-coloured photograph appeared three-dimensional. 'The result is a living being in perfect relief', wrote a contemporary reviewer, 'he will appear, for all ages, a very substantial ghost of the living and the departed'. This example, showing an ancestor of the donor, has a silk-lined lid shaped perhaps like a coffin.",
