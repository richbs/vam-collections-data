In the central compartment, bounded by a wavy white line, is a man and a women in early 17th century costume. The man is offering the woman a large spray from a plum tree and they stand under a tree bearing large fruits of different kinds - apple, pear, cherry and pomegranate. In the background are large sprigs of strawberry, pansy, honeysuckle and borage with a rabbit, birds and insects. In the top left hand corner is a church with the date 1636. In the top right hand corner is a house. Above each is a sun in scrolled clouds. The bottom left hand corner is occupied by a pool with swan, ducks and a dog swimming amongst flowers. In the bottom left hand corner are various animals - unicorn, rabbit, dog, deer and lion with a rose and a bird above. The picture is unfinished and there are two different methods of working: bright coloured silks in tent stitch and black silk in cross stitch.",

Plain sewing - hemming and seaming - was of particular value for the production of underclothes and basic household linens.  Only a privileged few, however, were able to afford the time and materials for embroidery.  \n\nUnlike many 17th century needlework pictures, this embroidery does not depict a scene from the Bible or mythology.  Instead, various disparate elements derived from contemporary prints create a harmonious composition which does not tell a story.  Animals, birds, fruit, flowers and the landscape act as a foil for the central figures of a man and a woman.  The unfinished state of this embroidery tells us much about the way in which needlework designs were planned and laid out, the backing fabric marked with the outline of the entire design before stitching commenced.  The date 1636 is incorporated into the embroidery of the building in the top left corner.",
