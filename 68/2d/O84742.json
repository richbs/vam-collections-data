A background scene of misty mountains above a river has been painted on the alabaster backing, giving the object a three-dimensional effect.  Framed in a beige alabaster frame, cracked in four places.  The bridge on which Rolla is standing can be seen in the background of the companion plaque (S.127-1992).",

Adapted by Richard Brinsley Sheridan from the play The Spaniard in Peru by the German Augustus von Kotzebue, the plot concerned  the Spaniard Francisco Pizarro waging a war of conquest against the Inca Empire of Peru.  The play caught the imagination of  Georgian audiences, who particularly appreciated the exotic sets and costumes, and the heroic Inca, Rolla, played by Kemble, who dies protecting the infant son of the Spaniard Alonzo and his Inca wife. The Prime Minister, William Pitt, declared Kemble as Rolla as the noblest actor he had ever seen.  The Museum has two similar roundels, each showing a different moment in Rolla's rescue of the infant.\n\nKemble was one of the most celebrated actors of his day and his image was often seen in paintings and engravings. Like his sister Sarah Siddons, with whom he frequently appeared, his style was best suited to tragedy.  He managed Drury Lane from 1788 until 1803, and Covent Garden from 1803 until 1808 when it burnt down, opening the new Covent Garden in 1809.",

In the play Rolla rescues the infant son of Cora, but is mortally wounded in the effort.  The play ends with a grand funeral march, in which the dead body of Rolla is carried to the tomb.  The play was a great success in England when it was performed at Drury Lane Theatre in 1799.  A note on the back of the companion plaque (S.127-1992) says: 'Mother got these in Italy in 1908'.  They were given to the Ashmolean Museum by The Reverend Iain Campbell of Lincoln, Nabraska, and passed to the V&A by the Ashmolean in May 1991.",
