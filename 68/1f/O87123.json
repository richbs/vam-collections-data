It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nLeslie Sarony and Leslie Homes were known as the Two Leslies. Leslie Sarony made his first stage appearance in a music hall act in 1911 and worked in concert parties, musical comedy and pantomime before and after military service in the First World War.  He began song writing while convalescing from a war wound and wrote Ain't It Grand To Be Blooming Well Dead and his first real hit If You Knew Susie. The pianist and composer Leslie Holmes showed early musical talent and after serving in the First World War he joined Henry Hall's band and broadcast with them in 1925. During the 1930s and 1940s the Two Leslies toured together in their variety show and became well-known radio entertainers.
