It has been applied through a metal stencil, and although adire cloths were usually made by women those made using mental stencils were generally produced by men.\n\nAdire cloths are usually made up of two strips of cotton shirting identically patterned and stitched together to form a shape that is roughly square so it could be used as a woman\u2019s wraparound skirt.  However, in this example there is only one strip of shirting.",
