Flanks of forest, \nDark with leaves, close in on either side, \nAnd in the midst a torrent rumbles down \nA twisted channel, swirling through the rocks. \n(Fitzgerald, <i>Aeneid</i>, VII, p. 216.) \n \nTo cover the region\u2019s steep terrain, the  \nartists hired a man to carry the sketching  \ngear and a donkey for Hannah to ride.  \nAfter quipping that the \u2018donkestrian  \nexercise\u2019 had done her good, Hannah  \nreported to her parents: \u2018I have made a  \ndrawing of the falls \u2013 and Mr. P. is  \nmaking a large striking view\u2019 (<i>Letters</i>,  \np.365).   \n \nThe present watercolour may be  \nthat view. It shows the hilltop town, its  \nbuildings traced in brown ink, its streets  \npopulated with miniscule figures, high  \nabove the white River Nar that flows  \nthrough a valley lined with olive trees.  \nBlue and purple mountains rise in the  \ndistance, their deep colours balanced by  \nthe strong green of the tangled plants  \nthat frame the scene. That proficient  \nforeground passage reveals a preoccupa- \ntion of the moment. Palmer wrote to  \nLinnell from Papigno: \n \nI would not have returned to England \non any account without seeing what I  \nhave lately seen \u2013 since I have turned \nmy attention particularly to fore- \ngrounds I have been happy enough to \nlight on some very beautiful and <i>poetic</i> \nspecimens and have found some which  \nwith the least touch of distance would \nmake most poetic pictures. (<i>Letters</i>,  \np.366). \n \nPalmer exhibited the drawing with the \nOld Water-Colour Society in 1844, \naccompanied by a quotation from  \nWordsworths\u2019 \u2018Upon Westminster  \nBridge\u2019: \u2018The river glideth at his own \nsweet will.\u2019\n<u>Catalogue of an Exhibition of Drawings, Etchings & Woodcuts by Samuel Palmer and other Disciples of William Blake October 20 - December 31, 1926</u>.
