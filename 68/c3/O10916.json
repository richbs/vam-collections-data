Tea canisters are usually known today as tea 'caddies'.  The word 'caddy' came into common usage in Britain in the late 18th century, and is probably a derivative of the Malay word for a measure of weight (kati) equivalent to about half a kilogram.\n\nUse\nThe sliding base at the bottom of this silver canister by Bowles Nash (active from 1723) allows for ease of refilling, while the interior lead lining can be removed for cleaning and refilling. The lead lining and the tightly-fitting slip-on cover would ensure the contents were kept dry. The cover of a tea canister is often thought to have been used as a measure before the introduction of the caddy spoon.\n\nDesign\nThe octagonal body, with incurved corners and stepped base and shoulders, are characteristic of canisters produced in the early 18th century. The lack of surface ornament is also typical of the period. The initials inscribed on the base could indicate that the pair were a marriage gift.",
