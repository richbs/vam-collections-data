Lilla Hailstone, Edward Hailstone, B DeR Morrall 1892\n\nNotes: This volume belongs to a group of (printed) pattern books produced in the 16th and early 17th centuries for the use of well-to-do skilled amateur embroiderers: 'these werkes belong chiefly to Gentlewomen for to passe away their time in vertuous exercises.' (Adrian Poyntz New and Singular Patterns and Works of Linen, 1591). Needle-lace was inseparable from embroidery during the 16th centuries, but during the 1570's and 1580's it developed dramatically and this change was reflected in the pattern books printed from 1587 onwards. The volume belongs to the very small number of books produced between 1590 and 1610 which concentrated on fully-developed cutwork (needle-lace worked on a linen ground) and detached needle-lace. It contains patterns for insertions and borders, for detached 'points', for the decorative ends of band strings (ties for collars) and for the corners of handkerchiefs or covers - the latter patterns would work either for lace or embroidery. Comparable patterns can be seen in Isabetta Catanea Parasole, Pretiosa gemma delle virtuose donne, Rome, 1598 [NAL 95.O Box 1] Pietro Paolo Tozzi, Ghirlanda di sei vaghi fiori, Padua, 1604 [NAL 95.O.26] Bartolemeo Danieli, Libro di diversi disegni, Bologna, 1630 [PD7P E.870-892-1901] (This information was provided by Miss Tina Levey).",
