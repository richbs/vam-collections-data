Major-General Hardwicke saw the performance and read a paper on the subject many years later (in 1832) to the Royal Asiatic Society. The painting shows the various stages of sheep-eating starting on the right, though they are not in strict order. They are: 1. Holding the sheep in the mouth; 2. Tearing open the underside;  3. Drinking the blood; 4. Tearing the ribs out; 5. Tearing the throat out; 6. Devouring the hind quarters; 7. Eating a salad of caustic madar leaves. Sheep-eaters were Aghor\u00ees, members of an extremist Hindu ascetic sect that refused to eat cooked meat.",
