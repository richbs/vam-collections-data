The V&A has a related portrait of the Dauphin by Bouchardon (Museum number A.190-1969), signed and dated 1745.\n\nAccording to a contemporary account of Bouchardon and his works (given in a posthumous 'Eloge Historique' to the Academy of Painting on 4 September 1762, by his admirer and friend Comte de Caylus), bronze medallions of Louis XV and the Dauphin were commissioned by comte de Maurepas for his ch\u00e2teau at Pontchartrain, and the King sat in order for Bouchardon to draw a portrait study which was used for medals, coins, and also a medallion portrait in bronze. The portraits of the King and Dauphin were subsequently unrecorded, but may well be those now at the V&A.",

The reliefs of the King and also the Dauphin (A.190-1969) were subsequently unrecorded, but may well be those now at the V&A.",
