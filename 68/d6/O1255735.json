An enthusiastic and skilled amateur, he was elected to the Photographic Society of London in 1869 and later contributed to photographic exhibitions. During long summer holidays to Scotland and the Lake District he recorded memorable occasions spent in the company of family and friends, in particular the artist, Sir John Everett Millais (1829-1896), the Liberal statesman, John Bright (1811-1889), and the Unitarian minister, William Gaskell (1805-1884).  \n\nEdward Aldham Leatham, M.P. for Huddersfield, was also a family friend and brother-in-law of his close political associate, John Bright.  Like Rupert Potter, Leatham was a Liberal and a Radical.",
