The lengthy sleeves worn by this woman illustrate a fashion which may be a relic of the ancient belief among the Turks that it was improper for women not to cover the hands. Over her wide shalvar or trousers she wears an entari or dress divided at the skirt to give a shawl-like effect. The outfit is completed by a silk shawl wound around the waist. The decoration of the interior is a curious mixture of the Gothic (the window), the contemporary French style (the European fringing on the sofa), and Turkish (the inlaid mother-of-pearl table). This may be a portrait of one of the relatives of Preziosi's Greek wife, but there is no positive evidence.",
