By this date Ken Dodd was a star, his name 'topping the bill' in the largest letters.\n\nKen Dodd (b.1927) learned his trade in music hall and variety, starting out in 1952 in Liverpool as a member of Don Ellis's Fairfield Concert Party, and topping the bill two years later at the Hull Palace as 'the North's New Star Comedian'. He worked on radio and the variety theatre circuit during the 1950s, becoming a well-paid performer with star billing by the mid 1950s. His ability to improvise on stage was extraordinary and led to his soubriquet 'Ken Dodd the Unpredictable'.\n\nHis first break in pantomime came at the Bradford Alhambra in 1959, and he became widely known through television in the 1960s where his 'Diddy Men' and 'Tickling Stick' became trademarks of his act.  Dodd had hugely admired the northern comics of the 1940s, of whom he once said:  'I think they left me to switch the light off. I am the last one. They've all gone. Frank Randle, Norman Evans. Max Miller. They're my heroes. They're my boys.'",
