This image, based on the 1616-1623 bust by Gheerart Janssen in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford-upon-Avon, became the logo of the brewing company because of the long association of the Flowers family with Shakespeare.  Edward Fordham Flower was the moving spirit behind a lasting memorial to William Shakespeare in Stratford, and his son Charles Edward Flower conceived the idea of a theatre incorporating a picture gallery, library and music room on the banks of the River Avon.  He presented the governors of the theatre with its riverside site, and largely funded the original Shakespeare Memorial Theatre himself which opened in 1879. \n\nIn 1926 when the theatre burned down, Sir Archibald Flower led the appeal for funds to replace it. His son, Colonel Fordham Flower, succeeded him as chairman of the board of governors for the new theatre.",

The bus may be a likeness since it was possibly commissioned by his son-in-law, John Hall, and Shakespeare's wife, Anne Hathaway, was still alive at the time the monument was erected (it was in place by 1623). Clearly both these people knew what Shakespeare looked like. Gheeerart Janssen's workshop was in London, close to the Globe theatre, and it is possible that he encountered Shakespeare there.",

Flower issued a national appeal for \u00a320,000 but since the response was poor, the money for the building came largely from his own funds.  He also presented the Governors of the theatre with the riversite site that it owns today and the 800-seat Shakespeare Memorial Theatre opened in 1879 and hosted an annual festival of Shakespeare's plays.\n\nIn 1926 when the first theatre burned down, the moving spirit for the appeal for funds for a new theatre came from Sir Archibald Flower and his son Colonel Fordham Flower who succeeded him as chairman of the board of governors for the new theatre.
