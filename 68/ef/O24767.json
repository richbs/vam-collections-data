This fragment is particularly fine example, providing in its shallow depth relief  in delicate detailing of scenes of everyday life: appraching a steam a woman holds the folds of her skirt (sarong), while servants carrying baskets wade through the water; the landscape elements are stylised into flamboyant foliage.  The frieze above and below is decorated with alternating flower and 'eye' motifs.   The stylisation of the human figures, and particularly the frontal treatment of the figures with the heads in three-quarter profile, is a convention preserved to this day in the shadow puppets (wayang kulit) of Java and Bali.",
