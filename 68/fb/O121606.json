Upper: 1 cm. plain weave with red weft and 3 cms with white weft. Turned and stitched in place with brown and magenta wool; on the fold there is a band of decorative oversewing in dark green and dark pink wool.\n\nDESIGN: Field: dark red ground with 5 bands of 5 guls, each has a quartered outer part in red and white outlined in dark blue and dark green. In the centre is a dark blue or dark green hexagon with 4 inward-pointing arrows, with a dark blue or dark green dot at the cardinal points and in the centre. Offset in 4 and 2 half rows are hooked crosses over X-motifs in dark blue or dark green. The wide vertical portion having white florets within a lattice.

On both side the flowerhead stripe of the main border extends downwards for 12 cms in parallel with 9 similarly decorated stems. Below the 12 cms there is 4.5 cms. where the stem narrows and is decorated with diagonal blocks of colour (as if the weavers changed their minds). The stems bear pairs of simple round flowers, two bands (3rd from the top and the top band) have dark pink silk centres.\n\nUpper band: following the undecorated outer border and before the plain weave, are two narrow bands of dark red and dark pink.",
