It is one of several instances in which they have explored urban clothing for a new generation of Indian women. They aim to provide a traditional yet fashionable alternative to western garments.  \n\nThe sari and fabric for the shirt have been handwoven using the time consuming double-ikat technique which reproduces a tessellated houndstooth pattern associated with western clothing. The accompanying long-sleeved shirt is tailored in a western style and very unlike the short-sleeved cholis that are usually worn with saris. Together the ensemble is a fusion of many cultural influences",
