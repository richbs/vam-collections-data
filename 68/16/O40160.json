The legend of the beautiful Psyche is written by Lucius Apuleius in the Metamorphoses, or Golden Ass. In the tale Mercury (a messenger of the gods) is sent by Jupiter to bring her back up to heaven to reunite her with her lover Cupid. \nThe story of Cupid and Psyche was by the 2nd century AD writer, Lucius Apuleius, in his 'Metamorphoses' (also known as 'The Golden Ass').  The widespread attention given to Psyche, the (mortal) daughter of a King and Queen, for her exceptional beauty, angers the goddess Venus greatly. She despatches her son, Cupid, to make her fall in love with a monstrous creature, but instead he falls in love with her himself.\nThe sulptor Thomas Campbell (1790-1858) was born in Edinburgh. He studied at the Royal Academy in London and instructed by Joseph Nolleken. In 1818 he went to Rome, where he set up his own studio. He returned to England in late 1829 or early 1830 and opened a studio in Leicester Square, London, while keeping his studio in Rome, where he would travel to buy his marble. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in north London.",
