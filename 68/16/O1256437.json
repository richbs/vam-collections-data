Inside the front cover, the words 'Mast. Hy. Hood, Sept 6th, 1848', written with delicate swirling script. The following page features the words 'Mercantile Correspondence', encircled by serpentine flourishes and floral garlands.\nThe remainder of the book is filled with draft letters dealing with routine matters of business. The letters are all dated, and range from 16 September to 17 November 1848. The letters are 'signed' by a variety of different names including D Williamson, E Simpson and J Brown. Businesses include drapers, wholesale grocers and stationers. The subjects of the letters include asking for references for suppliers, responding to invoices to dispute quotes, and requesting payment. \nAll are written very neatly in copperplate handwriting, and feature very few corrections or amendments.",

In 1823 he married Susanna Wilson, and they had five children. All their names, apart from the youngest, Susanna, appear on the exercise and copy books.
