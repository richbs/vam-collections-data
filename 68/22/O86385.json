The school was set up for charitable reasons and with royal patronage after the severe winter of 1872. The Venetian lagoon froze and the communities dependent on fishing were badly affected. The school revived the skill that had made Venice the major producer of needle lace in the 16th and 17th centuries. It made lace of every sort, and its lacemakers faithfully copied high-quality historical pieces. By the 1890s the school was also making lace in contemporary styles, like this stole. It continued to produce pieces of this style and quality well into the 20th century. \n\nThis stole came to the V&A from the collection of Mary, Viscountess Harcourt. She married on 1 July 1899. She may have bought, or been given, this stole new, perhaps on a European tour taking in Venice following her wedding. Her trousseau from Worth of Paris included black silk bobbin lace, also decorated with irises. The iris may have been a particular favourite of hers. Here it alternates with lily of the valley.",
