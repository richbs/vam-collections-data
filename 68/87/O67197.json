Upper; not available for inspection.\nDesign: Field: dark blue ground divided into three parts: the top and bottom have two complete and two half rows of linked lozenge-shaped compartments outlined in red/yellow/blue containing stylized floral sprigs in all colours.  The middle section has eight rows of two or three 'circular' floral arrangements linked by blue and white blossoms; although these look circular from a distance, they are more diamond-shape.\nMain Border: white ground with floral meander bearing predominantly red and blue blossoms framed by red and purple serrated leaves.\nInner border: probably a light brown ground with a floral meander of red blossoms alternating with green leaves.  Along the lower broder this pattern has been replaced by what appears to be an inscription.\nOuter border: light brown ground with alternating inward and outward facing stylised shrubs in various colours.",
