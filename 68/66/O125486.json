There is a tailor's label on the inside breast pocket. It states that the coat was made for Paul Crosfield (the donor's late father) by Austin Reed of Regent Street and that it would be ready for him on 05/10/1938. By the 1930s Austin Reed had transformed itself from a small firm into a dynamic and progressive tailoring business catering for a wide range of clients.  \n\nPaul Crosfield owned a veterinary practice in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. He bought the coat at Austin Reed's branch in Oxford or from Regent Street, London. As he was a country veterinary surgeon he did not wear it very much, except for occasional visits to London or for evening wear.",
