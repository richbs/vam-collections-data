No. 115 [P.27-1941], though on biographical and costume evidence it probably antedates it by twelve years. It has the feel of a portrait commissioned or given at the time of marriage. As is usual with female sitters, the handling is softer, smoother and more blended, and with shorter hatching strokes, than in the Sir John, but it is otherwise well within the range of Snelling's known work. \n\nSusanna was the daughter and co-heir of Sir Richard Brawne of Allscott, in Prestonon-Avon, Gloucestershire, by his wife Theodosia. She was married in August 1662, aged eighteen, by special licence, with consent given by her mother. She died at Richmond, Surrey, and was buried on 13 March 1672/3 at Quainton, Buckinghamshire. \n\n1 'Virtue lives after death I look down on the glory of the world Susanna Lady Dormer, outstanding by religion, by faith, by modesty, by patience, by prudence, by constancy and by sincerity; the most choice and missed wife of John Dormer soldier and Baronet, passed through the celestial gate of Death to Paradise: on the 24th day of February 1672/3.'\u201d\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1941</u>, London: HMSO, 1954.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n<b>'ANONYMOUS: English School, 17th century</b>\n\nMiniature portrait of Sir John Dormer, 1st Baronet (c.1640-1675).<i>\nThe frame engraved with an inscription, the sitter's name and the date 1674.\nOn parchment on card.
