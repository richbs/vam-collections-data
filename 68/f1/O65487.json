These uprights are carved proud of the three plain-faced horizontal railings which run behind them.  There are two tenons towards the outer edge of the underside of the relief acting as architectural fixings. The rear of the panel has a row of four carved 'dovetails' along the left hand side which has a smooth edgewhich would have slotted into the spaces between those of an adjacent panel set at right angles to it.",
