            "public_access_description": "The innovative design of this server stems from the fertile imagination of a jeweller. Unencumbered by the long tradition of silver flatware, Mina has approached the brief from a refreshingly new perspective. The elegant simplicity of a folded sheet forms both functional blade and useful handle. Although the design solution is excitingly simple, the attention to detail in texture and finish make it a gorgeously rich sculptural piece. The roll of the silver captures the motion of a wave, where silky smooth depths are contrasted by the pattern of the surface spray. The single moonstone focuses the eye and evokes the iridescence of fish scales and the glint of sun on sea.",
