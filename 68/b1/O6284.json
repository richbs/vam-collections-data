Taylor, Diane, various\nBaker, Malcolm and Richardson, Brenda, eds. <u>A Grand Design : The Art of the Victoria and Albert Museum.</u> London: V&A Publications, 1997. 431 p., ill. ISBN 1851773088.\nTrained as an architect, Keith Murray began designing glass in the 1920s when the depressed economic climate provided few opportunities for him to work within his chosen profession. Murray had immigrated to England in 1906, served in the air force in World War I, and then studied architecture in London. Interested in old glass and impressed with Scandinavian and Viennese glass he saw at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts D\u201acoratifs et Industriels Modernes held in Paris, he determined to improve English glass design. Murray was to play a major role in establishing a new, modern style in glass and ceramics and was hailed as Britain's best, indeed only truly International Modern designer. In Design for Today (1935), for example, the influential modernist designer Serge Chermayeff included Murray with Walter Gropius, L szl\u00a2 Moholy-Nagy, Wells Coates (see cat. 182), and Mies van der Rohe as those \"who have in the last decade been directly or indirectly responsible for industrial design and exhibitions of the highest class.\"\nMurray's modernism did, however, contain a strong element of traditional, particularly eighteenth-century, classicism. This strong glass vase, for instance, is a modernist reworking of Georgian-style flat-cutting. It also closely resembles the glass made at Orrefors in Sweden from the turn of the century (an influence Murray acknowledged). Similarly, this earthenware vase has overtones of eighteenth-century Wedgwood basalt ware, even as Murray's vase demonstrates a clean, architectural quality which his admirers identified with the 1930s modernist aesthetic.\nAs a leading exponent of modernism, Murray was an obvious choice in the selection of British designers for the 1937 international exhibition in Paris, where Murray showed this glass vase in the industrial design section. (The V&A's Circulation Department negotiated a gift of the vase from that show, adding to a group of Murray's works acquired beginning in 1934.)\nIn 1939 Murray returned to architecture, though production of his glass and ceramic designs continued into the 1950s; by the 1970s, however, the architect's 1930s design work was largely forgotten. In the mid-1970s Murray's work was featured in a travelling exhibition organised by the V&A as well as in the Museum's show of 1930s British design. Interviewed at the time, Keith Murray expressed astonishment that anyone would be interested in what he considered to have been \"bread and butter\" work undertaken only until he was able to practise as an architect.\n\nLit.
