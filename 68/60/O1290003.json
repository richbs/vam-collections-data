On some of the opposing pages are pieces of poetical text, seemingly unrelated, but which add another dimension to the reading of the book.\n\nThe work is a travelogue of sorts; an 'accounting of where her feet (and hands and mind) have taken her' (Jerome Rothenberg, from the preface of the book).\n\nKnowles has mined her original travel books and pasted them on to fresh sheets, further supplementing them with new material collected more recently on a European trip, annotated with explanatory footnotes.\n\nThe book accompanied an exhibition by the artist at the Emily Harvey Gallery in October 2000.",
