Worked from childhood in his father's studio, eventually specialising in scenes on the Thames and in Surrey; favourite later subjects included Yorkshire, Devon, the Lake District, Scotland, and particularly, after his first visit in 1847, North Wales. Exhibited 51 works at the RA between 1837 and 1869, 60 at the BI 1837-67, and 244 at the SBA 1837-67, becoming a Member of the last in 1842. Ruskin praised his exhibited work in 1857 and 1858, and the <i>Art Journal</i>obituary recorded that his 'feeling for nature constantly led him to lengthened periods of out-door study'. Died Barnes, 11 April 1865. His only child, Edwin, was also a painter. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i>1865, p191 (obit) \n\n<b>Landscape with Gypsies and Haymakers</b> \n1023-1886 Neg 56354 \nCanvas, 69.9 X 89.2 cm (27 1/2 X 35 1/8 ins) \nDixon Bequest 1886 \nBoddington exhibited several gypsy and haymaking subjects, especially early in his career, but not a picture with this title, although the present title may not be original.\"",
