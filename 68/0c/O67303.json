The imagery and patterns are derived from a variety of sources: contemporary industrial metal screens, details from Indian architecture and elements from historic Mughal carpets, drawn by the artist or taken from photographs. \n\nAll these patterns were scanned into a computer, manipulated digitally to achieve the desired scale and relative proportions and then transferred to the nylon screens used for papermaking. A base sheet of white linen pulp was laid down and then pigmented linen pulps were squeegeed through the screens, layer upon layer, wet on wet. Once the pulp screening was completed the work was pressed to extract water and then dried against aluminium panels to achieve a polished matte surface. Once dry, the surface was sealed and the final elements of the composition were applied using silk-screens.",

A base sheet of white linen pulp was laid down and then pigmented linen pulps were squeegeed through the screens, layer upon layer, wet on wet, to create the imagery. Once this process was complete the work was pressed to extract water and then dried against aluminium panels to achieve a polished matte surface. Once dry the surface was sealed and the final elements of the composition were applied in paint using silk-screens.",
