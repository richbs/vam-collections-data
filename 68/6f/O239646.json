Both together can also be viewed as a poster by unfolding the two prints and placing them side by side. The left print is the predominately black and white one (this Mus. No, E-984:2), the right print is the coloured one (Mus. No. E.984:3).\nBoth prints pick up the content of the photo-collages of the folder, where they are contained in (see: Mus. No. E.984:1).\nThis mainly black and white folded print contains the pictures of the left extension of the folder (main picture is North American Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North) and is overlapped by one single black and white image extruded into pixels. This pixelated image shows the training of the Nicaraguan National Guard by U.S. officers in Ocotal, Nicaragua.\nThe folded print contains 4 folds and thus 5 pages.",

The \"catalogue\" in this case is not documentation, but rather another exhibition venue. It could be described as a folding book or poster. The artist Esther Parada calls it an \"unfolding exhibition\". In using this experimental form she seeks to open up a dialogue between different elements of the work - such as the poster and the folder - as well as between the artist and viewer.\nThe work contained in this folder posits an historical framework dominated by the establishment and proliferation of United States military power throughout the hemisphere. This hierarchical relationship is represented visually through the expansion of a single image - the training of the Nicaraguan National Guard by U.S. officers in Ocotal, Nicaragua, 1927 - as a kind of pixel matrix (cit: taken from text within folder).",
