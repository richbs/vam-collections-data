The colour of black  basalt came from 'Carr', an oxide of iron suspended in water that flowed through coal seams and mines. It  was manufactured by Josiah Wedgwood from about 1768 and other manufacturers soon followed. Black  basalt does not need to be glazed and can just be polished to a dull sheen. \nThis creamer has an attractive low oval and ribbed form with a sprigged  band of stylised flowers and scrolls. Technical difficulties with producing  these repeated motifs is demonstrated here with the clear overlap of the  design where the band meets. The dark nature of basalt wares means that this is only evident on close inspection and may not have been a  mistake. The repeat of the band design may have fitted perfectly for the circumference of other shapes in the range.",
