            "public_access_description": "This is an original artwork for a fashion illustration by Marcel Fromenti for The Lady, a weekly magazine for women published since 1885. At the time it was made, Fromenti was the main artist for The Lady's fashion articles. The glamorous women in his drawings modelled both couture and high-end ready-to-wear garments with equal panache and elegance. Couture dresses and suits by leading Paris and London couturiers such as Christian Dior, Pierre Balmain and Norman Hartnell were drawn with the same flair as designs from British ready-to-wear labels such as Susan Small, Roecliff & Chapman, and Marcus. The articles described the fashion developments of their day in simple, accessible terms that contributed greatly to The Lady's popularity with its readers. Pencil notes record the designers, fabric and colour details, alongside technical instructions to the printers as to how these images should be incorporated into the printed page and at what scale.\n\nOn the left is an early design by Hubert de Givenchy, who launched his couture house in 1952. The youthful purity of line that is associated with his work is immediately visible in this suit. While the pencil skirt and fitted jacket with deeply notched shawl collar appear understated, the effect was achieved through skilful construction, cutting and use of proportion. On the right is an ensemble by Marc Bohan for Jean Patou, called \"Bourrasque\" ('Squall'). A loosely fitting swing jacket with large fur collar and cuffs is worn with a pencil skirt in matching woollen tweed, with a heavily textured tweed jumper and matching tweed hat.",
