This gives the illusion of a single three-dimensional image when viewed through a stereoscope designed to hold it. Sometimes, as here, stereographs were coloured by hand in paints or inks to make them more enticing and life-like.\n\nOwnership & Use\nStereographs were mass-produced. Viewing them was a popular amusement carried out in the home from the 1850s until the early 20th century.\n\nSubject Depicted\nIn this image a bride is seen looking into an ornate, gilded mirror. Only the reflection of her face is visible. It is a depiction of a presumably private moment which we might not normally expect to see. However, the camera has allowed us to spy on this event. Domestic, moral or private scenes were typical subjects of popular stereographs.",
