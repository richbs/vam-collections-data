At the bottom of the field are floral sprigs but elsewhere geometric motifs of toothed or hooked stars (large and small) including complex ones and some stylised animals and one boteh.\n\nMAIN BORDER: white ground with detached meander along the top and bottom, connected angular meander down the sides. Striped stems, serrated diagonal leaves and an infill of triangles surrounding the blossoms.\n\nINNER AND OUTER BORDERS: red ground with floral meander; green stem with mainly blue blossoms and triangular leaves.\n\nINTERMEDIATE OUTER BORDER: as inner but on dark blue ground with an orange stem and red blossoms. Each border is separated by a narrow border of reciprocal triangles.\n\nUpper and lower bands beyond borders: each have three rows of a chequered pattern: blue/white, green/red and blue/white.\n\nWARP: white wool; Z2S; 18 threads per inch (18 per dm).\n\nWEFT: red wool; Z-spun, unplied; mainly 2 shoots after each row of knots - sometimes 3 or 4 - after each row of knots; 9 knots per inch (40 per dm).\n\nPILE: wool; 10 colours: red, orange, dark green, light green, dark blue, light blue, dark brown, brown, black, white; asymmetrical knot, open to the left and tied around 2 threads; 81 knots to the sq. inch (1600 per sq. dm).\n\nSide finish: one cord oversewn with dark brown hair.\n\nEnd finish: 2 x 4 strands of warp loop plaits forming a square braid fringe finished with an overcast braid in blue wool. Each is 4\" long and begins after one row of weft-twining in red and green wool.",
