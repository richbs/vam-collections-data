Like the British Punch and Judy shows, Mourguet's show initially included the Italian commedia dell\u2019arte character Polichinelle or Pulcinella, but as the show developed the characters were based on the working class people who became his audience. Guignol by 1808 was a silk-weaver who could turn his hand to a variety of professions, and the other characters included his wife Madelon, the wine-loving cobbler Gnafron, and the gendarme Flag\u00e9ole. Unlike the anarchic Mr. Punch, Guignol is clever, courageous and generous, and his inevitable victory is the triumph of good over evil.",
