He was an influential teacher with a particular interest in life drawing and the human form. He also travelled widely and was particularly interested in African and South American sculpture and Paleolithic art. His interest in so called 'primitive' art, however, was rooted more in a sense of its popular appeal than its abstract formal qualities. His own work reflects this. The reclining figure here recalls Mexican sculpture, while the white outline used in many of his prints evokes the giant Romano-Celtic chalk figures still to be seen today on several hillsides in southern Britain.",

            "bibliography": "Timmers, Margaret (ed), <i>Impressions of the Twentieth Century: Fine Art Prints from the V&A's Collection</i>, London, V&A Publications, 2001\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>(George Claude) Leon Underwood (1890-1977)</b> \n\n<i>Harvest Corn</i>, 1943 \n\nLeon Underwood was an influential artist in inter-war Britain.  He worked in a wide range of media, covering various types of painting, sculpture and printmaking.  His etchings, wood engravings, linocuts and lithographs were produced both as fine art prints and as illustrations.  He also liked to experiment, often inventing techniques in areas he had no formal training.  This brought a particular vitality and vigour to his printmaking.  One consistent interest throughout his career was life drawing, which he both practiced and taught. \nThe human figure features in the majority of Underwood's works, and his two-dimensional work reflects his concern as a sculptor for volume and rhythm.  His portrayal of the human form also shows his admiration for the simplified, monumental forms of primitive art.  He began collecting African sculpture as early as 1919 and was particularly interested in Palaeolithic art.  From 1920 he travelled widely, visiting Iceland, the cave paintings at Altamira in France, and Aztec and Mayan remains in Mexico. \nLeon Underwood was also an influential teacher and philosopher.  He taught life drawing at the Royal College of Art and then at his own private school in Brook Green, London, attended by - among others - Blair Hughes Stanton, Gertrude Hermes, Henry Moore and Eileen Ager.  his influence extended beyond stylistic to more fundamental concerns.  By the late 1920s Underwood felt increasingly isolated from many contemporary artists, with their belief in abstraction for its own sake; he wished to emphasize the importance of subject matter.  His treatise <i>Art for Heaven's Sake: Notes on the Philosophy of Art To-Day</i> (published London 1934) was a response to a situation where he perceived that art and life had drifted apart, a state further aggravated by art's increasing elitism.  In Underwood's view many abstract artists looked at primitive art for inspiration, but missed the essential point that primitive art communicated the masses, and contributed to a general spiritual life through its understandable subject matter. \n<i>Harvest Corn</i> was created during the Second World War, during the time that Underwood was travelling round the country, engaged on camouflage work.  The print depicts the goddess of the harvest.  In many ways it is reminiscent of Underwood's Mexican reclining figures, inspired by the sculpture of the god Chacmool from Chichen Itz\u00e1, as well as by the beauty and colourfulness of the Mexican women.  The white outline, used in many of his prints, is here also evocative of the primitive chalk figures found on British downlands.  The print represents both the spirit of harvest and the power of nature, and also the fruit of the artist's labours.  As Underwood said: 'The artist is the sower who casts about him original though, woven out of his intuition and imagination, and when the conditions are right, germination takes place.  The artist is the sower who at the harvest time is over the horizon - on his way to sow new round'.\"\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1943</u>, London: HMSO, 1956.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n'<b>UNDERWOOD, Leon (1890-  )</b>\n \nHarvest Corn.\n<i>Signed and dated</i> Leon U/43.\n<i>Colour lino-cut.</i>\nE.120-1943\n\nPurchased under the terms of the A.M.
