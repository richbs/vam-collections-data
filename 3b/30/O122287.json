Similar buds in red and green are along the top outer sides of the niche which terminates in a pair of red horns.  Within the diamond niche is a cluster of purple, yellow and white flowers.  Below, in the panel, there is a vertical bar with a yellow horned diamond at each end and with green, white and blue decoration at either end.  Above the niche is a multi-coloured rosette attached to four palmettes (two red and two green) and supporting a sprig which ends in a triangle upholding three circles with a similar triangle on either side but upside down.\n\nBorders: there are 10 borders, from the inside:\n\n(1) narrow border of small diagonal blocks in many colours.\n\n(2) red and green with white knots linking the two colours.\n\n(3) light red ground with angular S-motifs, each with an extended centre enclosing a flowerhead; in all colours.\n\n(4) reciprocal stepped triangles in blue and red outlined in yellow.\n\n(5) and (7) narrow border of red and white diagonal blocks.\n\n(6) dark yellow ground with rosettes in many colours, every one bearing a large central diamond within which is a smaller rosette.  The two stems which link the rosette (except in the lower border) bear a pair of small flowers.\n\n(8) and (10) as (4) but in purple and red with yellow.\n\n(9) white ground with a row of six-petalled rosettes in most colours.",
