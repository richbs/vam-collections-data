From many of the references, it would appear that she was at some time working in the National Art Library of the V&A.  \nSketch books of this kind are valuable in showing the process through which a designer goes before producing the finished design. Because human bodies, ways of moving and fashions change, it is not possible to create totally authentic historical costume on stage, but to create a convincing period design does require considerable historical knowledge to whittle down complexity to essentials. Stone's thoroughness and considerable knowledge of historic costume that underlies the often simplicity of her finished designs.  Some of the sketches are taken from Gilray satires; the satires of late 18th and early 19th century conveyed their information and period with a minimum of information, and thus are an excellent guide to the characteristics of their period.",
