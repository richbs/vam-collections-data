Displayed and analysed under glass.\nThere is a very wide border with a narrow central area.  A narrow band runs down the sides and along the bottom: it has a pale ground with an angular white S-motif filled with 3 blue bands alternating with a mushroom S-motif infilled with 2 light blue and 1 pink band.  The S-motifs are linked by a blue star with a pink centre.  In the lower left hand corner two s-motifs collide.\nIn the wide main border there is a red ground diagonal stripe running in from the corner with geometric motifs.  The ground of the border is white with a regular pattern of S-motifs and diamonds and irregularly shaped 'leaves'.  \nThe central panel has a white ground with a band of a cartouche alternating with an angular rosette containing a cross and a diamond and a band with a cartouche and a small diamond with 4 large tulip-shaped leaves.\nThreads: 2S silk: beige, light blue, pink, black, white, light pink, light green, blue, mushroom, very light blue. The outlines are worked in blocks in black cross stitch.\nThere is an added black fringe along the lower end.",
