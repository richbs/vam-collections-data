Entered RA Schools 1807. Briefly a midshipman in the Royal Navy 1808. Exhibited 48 portraits at the RA between 1809 and 1838, and 40 works at the BI 1815-59. Early works were portrait miniatures; appointed Painter in Miniature and Portrait Painter to Princess Charlotte 1815. Won a BI prize for 'The Prophet Ezra' (1815). Studied in Rome 1815-18, with the 6th Duke of Bedford as his patron, and exhibited thereafter historical, biblical and mythological subjects as well as maintaining a successful portrait practice. Published an essay on the classification of colours, as an appendix to <i>Hortus Ericaeus Woburnensis</i> (privately printed 1825). In Italy and Paris 1826-31; visited the Continent in 1844 and 1846. Although he failed to be elected ARA (in 1825) - probably because he lived with his mistress and not his wife, he was a member of several Italian academies, and was appointed Painter of History and Portraits by both King Leopold of the Belgians in 1830 and Queen Victoria in 1837. He succeeded Sir David Wilkie as Painter in Ordinary 1841; knighted 1842. Held a one-man show in the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, 1843. Many of his works were engraved; he was also an accomplished etcher. He married three times: in 1809, 1846, and (according to the <i>Illustrated London News</i>) 1863. Died Marylebone, London, 18 January 1871; his studio sale was at Christie's 19-21 April 1871. His brother John was also an artist (see below), as was his son Angelo. \n\nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 28 January 1871, p1l9 (obit); <i>Illustrated London News</i> 28 January 1871, p91 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i> 1871, p79 (obit), 1879, p180; B Coffey <i>Drawings by Sir George Hayter</i> ... exhibition catalogue Morton Morris 1982 \n\n<b>The Angels Ministering to Christ</b> \n60-1872 Neg S643 \nCanvas, 172 x 136.5 cm (67\u00be x 53\u00be ins) after relining \nSigned and dated 'G. Hayter 1849' indistinctly br \nGiven by Angelo Collen Hayter (the artist's second son) 1872 \n\nPainted between 1847 and 1849 (although the composition was designed at least as early as 1841) and exhibited at the BI in 1850, size given in the catalogue as 81 by 68 inches, presumably including the frame. The title given in the catalogue was 'Our Saviour After the Temptation', accompanied by the following quotation from <i>The Gospel According to St Matthew</i>, chapter 4 verses 8-11: \n\nAgain, the Devil taketh Him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; and saith unto Him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve ... Then the Devil leaveth Him, and behold, Angels came and ministered unto Him. \n\nThe painting attracted little critical attention, perhaps because of the antipathy of the art establishment towards the artist; the <i>Art Journal</i> tersely noted 'the picture is large, and contains much that is beautiful in execution and expression'. \n\nThe composition of the figures is 17th-century Baroque in style, but the wild setting and free handling of paint owe more to 19th-century Romanticism. Hayter must have known the work of Delacroix, and this work may be compared with the religious paintings of the French artist such as 'Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane' (1826, for the church of St Peter and St Louis, Paris; it caused a great stir when it was exhibited at the 1827 Salon and when subsequently hung in the church), and the 'Pieta' (1843-4, for the church of St Denis of the Holy Sacrament, Paris; shown at the Salon 1846). Hayter was travelling on the Continent in both the 1820s and 1840s. The pose of Christ may have been adapted from that of Michelangelo's famous 'Palestrina Pieta'. \n\nThe painting was sold in the artist's posthumous studio sale (see <i>Prov</i>: below), as well as 45 sketches and studies (lot 357) and a 'brilliantly coloured' sketch (lot 635) which is probably for 'Our Saviour After the Temptation (P55-1982, below). The sketch shows the figure of God the Father in the dark clouds at upper left generating a lightning flash, an episode largely invisible in the darkness of the finished picture, until cleaning and conservation in 1987. \n\nThe picture is shown hanging on the wall in a pen and ink drawing of the Sheepshanks Gallery in about 1876 by John Watkins (V&A 80890). \n\nPROV: The artist's studio sale, Christie's 21 April 1871 (634, as 'Christ after the Temptation. The finished picture, 1848. Exhibited in the British Institution'), bought Bazaine \u00a318 7s 6d, perhaps on behalf of A C Hayter, who gave it to the museum 1872 \n\nEXH: BI 1850 (290)\n \nENGR: Etching by the artist 1849 \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal 1850</i>, p91; B Coffey <i>Drawings by Sir George Hayter</i>\u2026 exhibition catalogue Morton Morris 1982, pp29, 46\"",
