Inscriptions on many examples show that they were particularly used in spice stores and hospital pharmacies. The depictions of religious subjects on these and other maiolica wares served as devotional prompts enabling the layman to participate more directly in religious life, one of the foremost spiritual aspirations of the Renaissance.\nThe popularity of Saint Francis of Assisi (ca 1182-1226) stemmed from his devotion to prayer, poverty, repentance and obedience. During a period of illness, after a failed military campaign of the Assisians against Perugia, Francis's mind had begun to turn towards God. Some time later, following a series of dreams, St Francis renounced his life as a wealthy merchant's son and chose to follow the example of Christ, living among the poor and destitute. Towards the end of his life St Francis received the Stigmata, the physical wounds of Christ's Crucifixion.\nThe image of St Francis receiving the Stigmata on this drug-jar served to prompt the beholder to recall both the illness of St Francis, his subsequent commitment to the religious life, and the sufferings of Christ.",

During a period of illness, after a failed military campaign of the Assisians against Perugia, Francis's mind had begun to turn towards God. Some time later, following a series of dreams, St Francis renounced his life as a wealthy merchant's son and chose to follow the example of Christ, living among the poor and destitute. Towards the end of his life St Francis received the Stigmata, the physical wounds of Christ's Crucifixion.\nThe image of St Francis receiving the Stigmata on this drug-jar served to prompt the beholder to recall both the illness of St Francis, his subsequent commitment to the religious life, and the sufferings of Christ.",

Inscriptions on many examples show that they were particularly used in spice stores and hospital pharmacies. The depictions of religious subjects on these and other maiolica wares served as devotional prompts enabling the layman to participate more directly in religious life, one of the foremost spiritual aspirations of the Renaissance.",
