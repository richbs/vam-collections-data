The ensemble reveals his refined and sophisticated tailoring skills and deft use of colour and decoration. The jacket has inset bands of black braid, flanked by black gimp, looped in a semi-military manner. The braid is repeated down the skirt's centre-back kick pleat. It retains the original tape, bearing the model number 1523 and the name \"Toffee\".",

His unusually masculine Knightsbridge premises had dark panelled walls upon which he hung cavalry hats, and the salon displayed his collection of colourful miniature Napoleonic soldiers.  Creed\u2019s passion for military uniform was translated into his couture collections: garments trimmed with frogging, braiding an dipping, capes, tricorn hats (Simone Mirman and Ren\u00e9e Pavy regularly made hats for Creed) and fobs in place of buttons became Creed signatures.  After closing his house in 1966 Creed gave the V&A some model garments, including a mustard-coloured wool suit with decorative black braiding from 1953, which retains the original tape, bearing the model number 1523 and the name 'Toffee'.  The suits epitomise the elegant, elongated lines for which Creed was known, and presumably he decided they would well represent his work to future generations.",
