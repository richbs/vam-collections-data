Known as the Daftar Khana, or record room, it was built between 1574 and 1575. The three figures in the foreground, two seated and one standing, give a sense of its scale.\n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites. He set up a studio in Simla with Charles Shepherd and sold his prints sold to an eager public both in India and Britain.",
