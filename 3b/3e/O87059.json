The left-hand  bearded man is bending his knee in obeisance to the standing older figure with a grey beard who acknowledges the younger with outstretched arms.  In the foreground there are two large and one smaller clumps of serrated-leafed plants with pink-petalled flowers growing in alternate formation up the stems.  The older man is dressed in a loose pale green long-sleeved robe with an orange shawl wrapped round his left shoulder and body.  He wears a large loosely wound turban of Iranian style in a white fabric with horizontal bands of gold patterned with a fine black geometrical design ending in a pink fringe.  He is shod in gold slippers depicted in an Iranian manner with a sweeping sole terminating in a sharp point at the heel.  The bending figure is also dressed in a loose-fitting robe caught up at the waist.  The robe is yellow, patterned in gold with a bold half-drop design of flowering plants alternating with smaller four-pronged motifs with flicked-up ends. His white turban is also wound in an Iranian style and is patterned with narrow horizontal lines in gold and pink.  He wears red slippers with gold dots.\n\nThe painting has an inner border of buff-coloured strips of paper decorated with a gold scroll pattern of stylised foliage and flowers.  This frame is edged with gold lines which are outlined in black and white with an outer line in blue on the outer border which has an ivory-coloured ground decorated with alternating gold-edged red poppies and deep pink lilies.  The page has collaged margins of buff-coloured paper outlined on the inner side in white.  A darker beige strip of paper is stuck on the inner edge as the gutter for the album binding.",
