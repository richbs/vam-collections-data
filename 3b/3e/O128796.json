He has worked in various media - including kinetic sculpture, film, performance, and the making of environments - but the constant in his work has been drawing, either as a working tool, as a means of recording and observing, or as an end in itself. For Martin, drawing is a system of signs analogous to those of language, and also an intellectual process of enquiry, analysis and proposition. \n\nHis gift of drawings spans his career from the time he was a student drawing from the plaster casts in the Cast Courts at the V&A,  represented by this pen and ink wash drawing of a Gothic Arch from the Rosslyn Chapel, until the 1990s. For other drawings by Martin in the V&A collection see E.315-321-2006.",
