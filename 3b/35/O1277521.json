It was created by a 19th-century British sculptor, William John Wills (b. c. 1826; active 1856-1895). Wills was appointed Teacher of Modelling Ornament at the National Art Training School in 1852, and remained in post until 1854, or possibly 1857. He exhibited at the Royal Academy jointly with his brother Thomas until 1884. This bust was bought for the Museum for 10s. 6d. in December 1864, and was probably made in 1863 or 1864. It is said in the contemporary manuscript Museum Registers of 1864 to be 'modelled from the portrait by Van Jansen', almost certainly a reference to the bust of Shakespeare on his tomb in Stratford-upon-Avon attributed to the Netherlandish sculptor Gerard Johnson (active c.1612-23).",

It was subsequently accidentally omitted from CMS, and re-discvoered in a Ceramics store at Blythe House, Hammersmith by the Ceramics Curator, Judith Crouch, who alerted Sculpture.\nAnother bust of Shakespeare also by Wills was acquired at the same time (inv. no. 539-1864); this was apparently based on the bust on Shakespeare's tomb in Stratford-upon-Avon, and was written off in 1944.",
