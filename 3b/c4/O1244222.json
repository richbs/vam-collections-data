It was made by Hornby Hobbies Ltd. as an official product of the Olympic Games held in London in 2012. \n\nMore specifically, this object is a mechanical bank, as inserting the coin results in a movement in the mechanism, and in this case a choclate reward. Mechanical banks have been used for centuries to teach children about money and to encourage them to save.\n\nThis example attempts to appeal more strongly to children by tying-in with the contemporary event of the Olympic Games, and featuring the characters of Wenlock and Mandeville, the Olympic mascots that were strongly promoted among children in the run up to the Games. Like other Hornby merchandise produced for the Olympics, the box for this money box is heavily branded and includes 'Did you know' facts to explain the symbolism of the mascots' appearance.",
