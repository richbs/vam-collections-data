In the late 1960s, sometimes with Nigel Waymouth as Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, he created psychedelic posters for many of the English bands of the time, and decorated and advertised Nigel Waymouth's King's Road boutique, Granny Takes a Trip. He also designed for concerts held at the UFO club and Saville Theatre, and for underground magazine Oz. Their influences came from the decorative and eroticised designs of Art Nouveau, combined with the melting rainbow colours of LSD visions and pop art inspirations from the post-war media; traces of Disney, horror movie monsters and comic book characters and can often be seen  hiding amongst the images.\n\nThis artwork was designed to advertise a smoking jacket available in the King's Road shop Hung On You. It makes the link with psychedelic art, 1960s fashion and drugs by depicting a Chinese man with opium pipe in a smoking jacket the shop was selling.",
