It seems to have been pieced across the top after being embroidered; the design and the colouring are the same but this section extends slightly on the right hand side. There is a border along the bottom \nwith a white ground and a downward pointing mauve blossom on a curving stem bending to the lower right surrounded on 4 sides by a narrow band which extends part way up the sides - this has tiny pink and white flowers and green leaves. \n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  There are chevron lines in green and blue [or dark green]. \n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: white ground with triangular pink blossom with round blue centre pointing upwards, small central mauve flower with pair of very small striped birds below it, same triangular pink blossom but with a triangular blue centre pointing downwards and iris-like flowers with pair of tiny birds to the right of it.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] white ground with a straight chequered stem with 2 cartouche leaves and a red flower at the end between 2 blue flowers.  At the base of the stem are 2 birds which would have been upside down to the wearer, alternating with a straight chequered stem, pair of small birds, 3 red flowers and 3 white flowers around the lowest one.\n[b] wider stripe: white ground with a circular arrangement of 8 tiny white flowers in 3 lines, a red rosette above it and a pair of birds alternating with an arrangement in which there is a pair of tiny white trefoil flowers, 2 white flowers, an almost semi-circular grouping of tiny white flowers and 3 birds.",
