Hope at the Oxford New Theatre in December 1962. It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn\u2019t needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nHarry Worth began his career on radio in 1946, and performed as a self-taught ventriloquist in variety. He is best remembered for the television series Here's Harry which began in 1960, in which he played the diffident resident of 52 Acacia Avenue where he lived with his cat Tiddles, and for this he won a Variety Club Award in 1962.",
