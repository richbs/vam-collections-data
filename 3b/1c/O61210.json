The oil gilding is coated with a translucent yellow glaze, and over this are stencilled and painted decoration of butterflies, flowers, stars, and repeating ornament. The bed-head is inset with two large bevelled mirrors either side of a painting of the 'Judgement of Paris' in medieval style, by Henry Holliday, R.A.  The bed posts are inset with painted vellum or paper and textile fragments under glass, within gothic-shaped recesses.  The foot of the bed is inscribed 'Vita Nova', and on the back of the head-board, 'William Burges me fieri fecit' and 'Anno Domini MDCCCLXXIX'.  The foot of the bed has quatrefoil piercings and rows of turned balusters. In the centre is a carved relief of a shield with a heart, and two hares on either side. The side brackets at the head end of the bed are carved with grotesque figures, one female, the other male. The sides of the bed have short turned balusters supporting a rail. The head and foot posts have turned finials surmounted with rock crystal half orbs.",

He designed every aspect of the house himself. The exterior is in the Reformed Gothic style. The interior is in Burges\u2019s own distinctive richly ornamental style, which was influenced by medieval art. Medieval prototypes provided the inspiration for the colourful painted decoration that adorned much of his furniture.\n\nThe theme for the Guest Chamber was \u2018Vita Nova\u2019 (New Life). The flower and animal motifs suggest a garden full of new life. The entire bed is gilded and richly ornamented with carvings, mirrors, painting, fragments of illuminated manuscripts under glass and rock crystal. Burges designed the other furniture in the room to match. He derived the ornament for the bed from medieval furniture.\n\nOn loan to National Trust Knightshayes Court.",

On March 12, 1879, the Book records 'Bedstead in deal, carved panels mahogany all carving except Nicholls', made by Walden at a cost of \u00a339 13s. On June 25 1879 the Estimate Book records 'Carving to Bedstead Guests room Nicholls 15/15/0', presumably the carver, Thomas Nicholls.\n\nSet into the headboard was a painted panel, The Judgement of Paris, by Fred Weekes. This had originally formed part of a glazed panel in Burges's rooms in Buckingham Street.\n\nThe bed and the washstand (W.4-1953) were both lent to the Exhibition of Victorian and Edwardian Decorative Arts held at the V&A 1952-3. Correspondence in the exhibition file indicates that Oliver Poole was originally asked to lend the bed but he subsequently requested that Col. T.H. Minshall D.S.O. be acknowledged as the owner. When approached about giving both the bed and washstand to the Museum, Mr Poole confirmed that he and his mother, Mrs.Minshall, would be happy to present both. He subsequently requested that the bed (and presumably the washstand) be recorded as given by Col. T.H. Minshall, D.S.O.",
