Dyce 2478 is the engraving). It has been suggested that the drawing is after a painting and shows the picture in its frame. The oak leaf frame is shown in the print too. But the print is lettered 'Carolus Cesius inv. et del.', from which we may infer that there was no painting, but only our drawing. Cesio is little known as a draughtsman.",
