The sculpture is made of cast iron, a material previously only used for industrial use. The sculpture shows a shepherd who, upon discovering one of his sheep has been killed by an eagle, fires an arrow and kills the eagle.\n\nThe Eagle Slayer was originally displayed at The Great Exhibition in 1851. It stood outside the original V&A building when it was the South Kensington Museum. The Eagle Slayer was once again reunited with this building when it was brought to Bethnal Green in 1927.\n\nThe sculpture is based on one of Aesop's fables .. unwittingly we give to our adversaries the means of our own destruction.  The eagle has just slain a lamb and the shepherd boy is exacting his revenge finds a feather dropped by the eagle.  From the feather the boy fashions the most accurate arrow to shoot the bird on its return.",

            "history_note": "The Eagle Slayer was made in 1851 by the popular Victorian neo-classical sculptor, John Bell. The sculpture is made of cast iron, a material previously only used for industrial use. The sculpture shows a shepherd who, upon discovering one of his sheep has been killed by an eagle, fires an arrow and kills the eagle.\n\nThe Eagle Slayer was originally displayed at The Great Exhibition in 1851. It stood outside the original V&A building when it was the South Kensington Museum. The Eagle Slayer was once again reunited with this building when it was brought to Bethnal Green in 1927.\n\nIn 2004 the sculpture was removed for urgent conservation work. Research revealed how the Eagle Slayer would have originally looked in 1851. Old paint layers were removed from the statue's surface and the rust damage was treated. Close analysis of the paint layers told us the original sculpture had been painted white to imitate Carrara marble. The statue had been painted black to reflect the late Victorian fashion. The Eagle Slayer today has been repainted to closely match the original white colour.\n\nHistorical significance: The first statue made of cast iron",
