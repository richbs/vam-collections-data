Full citation: \n\n\u201c<b>Miss Wells</b>\n<b>c.1690-1700</b>\n270-1906 \n\n<b>Oval 80 x 67 mm</b>\n\nFeatures stippled in pale grey and sanguine with brown, yellow and blue, and with green-blue in the eyes, on a pale carnation ground; hair in brown wash, hatched and stippled with darker colour and with some gouache lights, over the carnation; chemise in white and grey over an off-white wash; dress in transparent blue washes with some black shadow; background a brown wash, hatched and darkened to left, lightening to the right; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Possibly loss of sanguine from the face; a few rubs and marginal abrasions; 'treated in the ether-chamber for oxidation ... April 1949'; otherwise good. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Centre left: <i>PC</i> (see D in Appendix 2). \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Nineteenth- or early twentieth-century copper-gilt locket; the back convex, the sides with two channels separated by a bead rising to the bezel, which holds the nearly flat glass by its bevelled edge; the hanger, which is soldered awkwardly to the top of the locket, is a ring of D-section set on a short-waisted column and has a pointed knop on the top. When acquired, the miniature was said to be in 'a brass frame'. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Julian Senior, his sale, Christie's 15 May 1906, lot 96, bt (42 gns) by E M Hodgkins on behalf of the Museum. \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> Tokyo 1975, no. 83 (as by Lawrence Crosse) . \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Catalogue of Miniatures</i>, 1908, p. 12; Foster 1914-16, vol. I, p. 64 (citing the price paid for this miniature as evidence that connoisseurs were revaluing 'Lawrence Crosse'}, vol. II, p. 90, no. 93; Long 1929, p. 108; Long 1930, p. 15, fig. 62; Whinney and Millar 1957, p. 98n.; Foskett 1963, p.83; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 12. \n\nIn pose, Miss Wells is slightly exceptional in the <i>oeuvre</i> of Cross; the obliquely downcast eyes and the turn of the head are less formal than usual and perhaps mark a response to the influence of Kneller. After Wissing's death in 1687, Cross's work increasingly reflects the direct and naturalistic portraiture of Kneller. Otherwise, there are few close dating points in this portrait, and a wide span of c.1690-1 700 is all that can be proposed. \n\nThe identification of the sitter is sufficiently unglamorous and vague for it to be credible. It appears to be traditional and may have been supported by an inscription on the brass frame in which the miniature originally came to the Museum. \n\nMiss Wells may have been the daughter of the Mr Wells of Sandbach and the same woman who married John Lee of Cotton in Shropshire. He was born before 1666, the fourth son of Thomas Lee of Darnhall, and of Frances Venables; John Lee died in 1738. (1) He might well have married in the decade beginning 1690, which would make his bride about the right age for this portrait. On the other hand, the unusually expressive nature of the pose might be taken as indicating that the sitter was an actress. \n\n1 Burke.1834-8, vol. III (1838), p.315.\" ",
