The intaglio relief depicts Laksmi, the Hindu goddess of good fortune and beauty, standing on a lotus coming out of the  sylized waves of waters, whilst two elephants each holding a pot in their trunk and each standing on a lotus shown on artistically drawn creepers, lustrate with water (laksmi-abhiseka). (The commonly used term by the scholars and art-historians, gaja-laksmi, is a misnomer.) On either side the stylized mountains are shown which may represent the Himalayas, and in that case the waves may represent the river Ganges. Both the Himalaya mountains and the Ganges represent the holy land of Aryavarta. But Laksmi was not born from the Ganges, she came out of the milk-ocean when it was chruned by the Gods and demons.",
