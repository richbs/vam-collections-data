I and XIII (E.192 to 207-1924), 30 preparatory sketches and life studies (E.222 to 251-1924)] for stone panels for the Stations of the Cross in Westminster Cathedral, [also with a set of wood-engravings (E.208 to 221-1924) after finished panels, published by St. Dominic's Press, Ditchling]. The studies show the general arrangement of figures and lettering. The working cartoons show the structural lines with colour indicating the depth of the cutting. The designs are 1/24th, and the studies and cartoons 1/2, actual size.\nThe original small scale drawing of the complete set of Stations, made for submission to the Cathedral Architect, was purchased by the British Museum from an exhibition at the Alpine Club in 1918.\nThe actual panels executed from the cartoons were carved in Derbyshire carboniferous limestone (Hoptonwood stone), and it is important to note that the carving was done direct from the drawings. In no case was the sculpture cut, as is usually the practice, by mechanically following a model first made in clay. All the touching out and 'claw' work of the carving was done from these cartoons in Mr Eric Gill's workshops at Ditchling, and the completion of the chisel work was done in situ. The only exceptions were Nos. II, X, XIII, the first three completed, these were finished at Ditchling before erection, very little work being done to them afterwards. The first design, that for No. V, was made in 1913, and the completed stone panels were erected as follows:\nX - August 1914\nII - November 1914\nXIII - March 1915\nV - October 1915\nIII and IV - May 1916\nVI - November 1916\nVII and VIII - September 1917\nIX, XI, XII and XIV - March 1918.\nThe Stations were canonically erected in Westminster Cathedral on Good Friday, 1918.\n\nProvenance: E.2989 to 3016-1923 were bought from The Goupil Gallery (William Marchant & Co.) on 2nd July 1923 for \u00a398.00.00.",
