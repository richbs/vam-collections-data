He was inspired by the architecture and artefacts seen there and absorbed their abstract, formal qualities into his prints made during the 1940s. After experimenting with modulated line, in a series of drypoints, Albers went on to make a series of lithographs collectively titled 'Graphic Tectonic' with very precise linear structures.  He then began work on a series of woodcuts, in some of which, like this one, the organic pattern of the wood grain within the printing block is highlighted through contrast with very precise geometric patterns which Albers cuts into them.",
