A main border contains outward facing isolated sprigs each with a green serrated leaf, a red and orange flower and a red bud.  In the centre of the cover is a lobed medallion formed by a red band which loops to create 4 inward facing boteh-shaped leaves.  There is a round flowerhead in the centre with red petals between green and orange leaves. This is encircled by a fine green stem and pointed red flowers.  Four red flowers, each with a pair of leaves, fill the medallion.  Offset bands of a small curved floral sprig decorate the field; these red flower change direction along the central horizontal axis.  The borders and the field are poorly decorated compared with the densely-packed medallion.  There is a white cotton interlining but the embroidery has not been worked through this.  The backing and the facing have been badly attached and do not fit properly.\nBacking: yellow ground with closely-set rows of a floral motif: white and red blossom, purple centre, 2 red buds on pale green stem and leaves.\nFacing: striped; bias cut; silk warp and cotton weft.  Red, yellow, green., light blue and brown.\nThe embroidery may be Indian, but the backing and facing are Persian.",
