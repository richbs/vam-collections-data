When news of this reached London on 11th February 1779, he at once became a national hero. Wedgwood was quick to respond to and exploit such political events. Initially he had difficulties finding a suitable portrait of Keppel to copy, and on 1st March he complained that he could have sold 'thousands at any price'. Within two weeks of this date a model had been prepared and the portrait already put into production.",
