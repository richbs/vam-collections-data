However, the Sinhalese monarchy had been abolished in 1818. The royal family had been pensioned off and settled in India.\n\nThis watercolour comes from an album of 63 coloured drawings of Sinhalese occupations and castes. A local artist made it around 1830 for a Mr Wells. He was presumably either the donor, Robert Wells, who gave it to the V&A in 1869, or a relative of his. \n\nIndian artists made Company Paintings for the British in India. They often used devices found in European painting. However, the style of this illustration owes much to early 19th century painting in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe British public were very interested in Sri Lanka and its people in the early 19th century. James Cordiner produced two volumes in 1807 giving a description of the island and containing an account of a tour round it in 1800. In 1808 Samuel Daniell produced A Picturesque Illustration of the scenery, animals and native inhabitants of the Island of Ceylon.",
