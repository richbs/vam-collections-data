Dickens liked the image overall but felt that Leech had not captured the face or the position of the hat well enough, and commissioned Hablot Browne to portray Harley in the published text. Nevertheless in 1843 Leech was commissioned to illustrate A Christmas Carol and became one of Dickens' closest friends.\n\nThe actor and singer John Pritt Harley (1786-1858) was born in London and began his stage career as an amateur. He made his first professional appearance as Marcelli in The Devil's Bridge at the English Opera House in July 1815, and in September that year at Drury Lane Theatre as Lissardo in The Wonder.  He went on to play leading comic roles in operas, succeeding to the types of parts previously played by his friend John Bannister. Harley joined the company at the St. James Theatre in December 1835 when the theatre was opened by John Braham.\n\nDickens based the play on his sketch The Whinglebury Duel and although  it was well received, it is clear from Dickens' later correspondence that he regretted his early dramatic forays at the St. James's Theatre, including The Strange Gentleman.",
