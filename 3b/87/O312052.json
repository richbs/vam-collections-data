The signature of Giuliano de' Navi also appears on a larger mortar with different rib decoration, signed with what appears to be his full name and dated 1490 and on two other mortars dated 1515, as well as several other extant examples. It is unusual for so many signed mortars from the same foundry to have survived, particularly of this early period, with two (and possibly two others) carrying the same dates. No other example of ribs with the same profile has been identified and their apparent application after casting is not the standard method of facture for mortars. This observation, coupled with the apparent lack of use of the mortar, raises questions about the authenticity of this piece, which must be considered as possibly 19th century.",

The signature of Giuliano de' Navi also appears on a larger mortar with different rib decoration, signed with what appears to be his full name and dated 1490 and on two other mortars dated 1515, as well as several other extant examples. It is unusual for so many signed mortars from the same foundry to have survived, particularly of this early period, with two (and possibly two others) carrying the same dates. No other example of ribs with the same profile has been identified and their apparent application after casting is not the standard method of facture for mortars. This observation, coupled with the apparent lack of use of the mortar, raises questions about the authenticity of this piece, which must be considered as possibly 19th century.",
