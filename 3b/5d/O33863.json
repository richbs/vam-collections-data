It  is a powerful example of a type of jewellery known as memento mori (roughly translated from the Latin as 'Remember you must die'). \n\nOwnership & Use\nThe skeleton and coffin reminded the wearer that death, and therefore judgement, were certain, and so it encouraged a virtuous life.  The inscription, however, shows that the wearer believed that we need not fear death.  It states boldly in English that through Christ's resurrection - his sacrifice on the Cross and his rising from the dead - we are all 'sanctified' or made holy.  His death takes away our sins.\n\nPlaces\nIn 1856, when the V&A bought the jewel for \u00a321, it was believed to have been found in the grounds of Torre Abbey, Devon. However, this does not mean that it had any connection with Torre Abbey when it was a monastery. Henry VIII ordered the Dissolution of the Monasteries (their closure) in the later 1530s, and the jewel appears to date from no earlier than the 1540s. Parts of the abbey were in due course converted into a private house. We know nothing definite about the history of the jewel until the V&A  acquired it. It was probably sold by the Cary family  who lived in the house from 1662 until the early 20th century.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nThis jewel, reputedly found on the grounds of Torre Abbey, is one of the Museum's early acquisitions of Tudor goldsmiths' work. In the mid-sixteenth century - around the time the pendant was made - the Torre Abbey property passed from the ownership of the church to that of a private family named Pollard following the dissolution of the monasteries during the Reformation. Memento mori jewelry such as this, with its unflinching use of the symbols of death and its purposeful message - \"remember you must die\" - was widely worn in Western Europe during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Its intention was to encourage virtuous living, thereby distinguishing it from mourning jewelry of later periods, which most often commemorated the deaths of particular individuals. Moresque decoration such as that on the coffin was in wide use throughout Europe from the 1530s, but the inscription confirms the pendant's English origin. \n\nLit.
