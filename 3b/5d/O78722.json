Alexander Fisher exhibited a painting of roses probably like this one at the Royal Academy before he began to show his highly decorative enamels there.\n\nPeople\nAlexander Fisher was born in Stoke-on-Trent, the  son of a potter. He studied at the South Kensington Schools from 1881 to 1884, when he was sent to Rome to assist W.M. Palin in copying tapestries for the South Kensington Museum. He became interested in metalwork as a result of lecture given to the students by M. Dalpayrat, a French enameller. Fisher went to Paris to study enamelling techniques and on his return to London set up a workshop. He became head of the enamelling section at the LCC Central School of Arts and Crafts in 1896, and set up his own school in Kensington in 1904. His work was widely exhibited in Britain and on the Continent. Fisher wrote extensively on metalwork for The Studio and the Art Journal and designed embroideries for the Royal School of Needlework.",
