A cash pattern has been cut into the base to reveal the inner wall of the pot - a feature that would not be visible except when pouring the tea. A small cartouche with the name Menghou in seal script appears below the handle.\nThe sheng was a particularly popular decorative motif in the Qing dynasty as a rebus for 'growing' or 'give birth to', a word also pronounced 'sheng'. \nThe teapot is one of a pair, but since they were hand-made the two pieces are not identical. Even the brown clay fired to a slightly different colour.\nA very similar teapot is in Dresden (N93, PO 3896), which was catalogued in 1721.",

The sheng was a particularly popular type of decoration in the Qing dynasty (1644-1912). At this time it was used to represent the Chinese word for 'growing' or 'give birth to', which is also pronounced 'sheng'. \nThis teapot is one of a pair, but since they were hand-made the two pieces are not identical. Even the brown clay fired to a slightly different colour. They were listed in the inventory of the great British collector William Beckford after his death in 1844. The two teapots appeared in the sale of his estate in 1845, and in the same year illustrations of them featured in the Illustrated London News.",

London: V&A Publishing, 2008, pp. 88-89.\nMasterpieces entry\nThe extraordinary teapot was made in Yixing, a small town located a little way inland from the coastal city of Shanghai. It is modelled to in the shape of a sheng, a Chinese musical wind instrument formed by a group of hallow reeds or bamboo tubes of different heights. \n  \nThe rise of Yixing to prominence was the result of the changeover from whipped tea, which as prepared in a bowl, to steeped tea in China, which could be prepared in a pot, the latter becoming prevalent in the sixteenth century. In Yixing potters discovered deposit of a clay known as 'purple sand' that fires to a variety of rich brown colours. Yixing clay is highly plastic and as a result even amateur potters could mould it into the desired shape. It needs no glazing and remains slightly porous, allowing any unpleasant smells from the boiled water to evaporate, while retaining the aroma of the tea - or at least so believed the Chinese tea connoisseurs. According to Chinese textual sources, it was a Buddhist monk who first used Yixing clay to make teapots, and he signed his work upon completion. Since then Yixing potters have prided themselves on their creativity and dexterity, and they enjoyed higher social status than their Jingdezhen contemporaries.\n\nYixing teapots were exported in some quantity to Europe, where they inspired imitation in Delft, at Meissen and in Staffordshire (see p.90). This teapot and its pair were once owned by the eccentric millionaire antiquarian and collector William Beckford, and similar pieces entered the Dresden collections of Augustus the Strong before.",
