            "public_access_description": "The word \u2018miniature\u2019 describes a technique of painting in watercolour rather than the size of a painting. Miniature painting developed as a separate art in the 16th century and in Britain it became predominantly a portrait art.\nThis miniature was formerly thought to be of Louise de Keroualle, Duchess of Portsmouth and one of Charles II\u2019s mistresses. Although not Louise, she must be a lady of the court. Nicholas Dixon was at the height of his fortunes at this time having succeeded Samuel Cooper to the coveted post of King\u2019s limner in 1672. The bold and unusually elaborate execution is indicative of the way his style adapted to his clientele at court. The use in particular of gold in rendering the gold of the earring was unusual in late 17th-century miniatures when yellow paint was generally used to simulate the desired effect. The whole effect, extravagant in its colour and palpably sensuous in its appeal surely indicates that the sitter was special, perhaps one of the ladies close to the monarch. \n\nIn the 1670s flesh was in fashion and Dixon was clearly influenced by Peter Lely\u2019s round faced figurative style and his almond shaped, elongated eyes, half-closed, which according to one commentator \u2018convey languorous lasciviousness\u2019. These mannerisms were particularly noticeable in Lely\u2019s portraits of the Beauties of Charles II\u2019s court, painted 1666\u20138. At this time, however, it was Charles II\u2019s mistresses who led the way at court in terms of fashion, and not the Queen as had been true in Charles I\u2019s day. This miniature is a particularly arch example of this tendency.",

Carl Winter expressed his doubts when cataloguing the recently acquired miniatures from the Buccleuch Collection in 1942. (1) The identification has attracted no recent support, and there have been no other suggestions. Yet the lady, painted in the mid-1670s, is likely to have been of the Court. Dixon was at the height of his fortune as successor to Cooper's King's Limnership, and the miniature is elaborately finished and of superb quality. Does the fact that it has retained its original gold locket indicate an uninterrupted family provenance? \n\nIf so, it could have descended from Anne (1651-1732), <i>suo jure</i> Countess, and subsequently Duchess of Buccleuch, the widow of James Scott, Duke of Monmouth (executed 15 July 1685) and could represent her. Perhaps more probably, in view of the idiom of the portrait, it could have descended from Ralph Montagu, 3rd Earl and 1st Duke of Montagu, who married 24 August 1673 as his first wife Elizabeth (1646-1690), widow of Joceline Percy; 11th Earl of Northumberland (<i>d.</i>May 1670). She was the youngest daughter of Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton and was very much one of the Court beauties. She was thought to be a candidate for the hand of the Duke of York after the death of the Duchess (Anne Hyde, 31 March 1671). \u2018Shee, having mist her ayme of Dutchess of York, will not long continue a widdow\u2019. (2) She turned down, among others, the young William, Duke of Somerset (1652-1671) and is said to have avoided the King's bed only by going to Paris, where she was wooed by Montagu, the British Ambassador and architect of the recently Signed secret Treaty of Dover (1670). She was worth \u00a36,000 a year, and the match greatly forwarded Montagu's career. The standard portrait of her at this period is by Lely at Windsor. (3) Judging likenesses of these fashionable beauties is, however, extremely hazardous, and the possibility that Elizabeth was the sitter for this miniature can only be taken as arising from the possible Montagu provenance. \n\nA considerable nucleus of the Buccleuch miniatures came from Montagu House, passing with the rest of the property at the marriage (2 May 1767) of Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch, to Elizabeth (1743-1827), daughter and heiress of George Brudenell, 4th Earl of Cardigan, by his wife Mary, sole heiress of'[ohn, the last Duke of Montagu. Elizabeth, however, seems to have purchased miniatures to add to the Collection, so that when they were finally inherited by her grandson Walter Francis (1806-1884), the 5th Duke, they were already a mixed bag. The 5th Duke was a serious connoisseur and added substantially to the Collection, as did his son William (1831-1914), the 6th Duke. Many of the miniatures in the Collection have clearly been through the trade and have been re-framed or otherwise attended to in their physical state - see for example the Flatman <i>Self-Portrait</i> (Cat. No.130). When sold by their original owners (or when a family is otherwise needing to raise money), miniatures tend to lose their gold settings, so the nearly intact gold locket on this miniature does suggest that it may have been part of the Montagu nucleus rather than the Buccleuch purchases for the Collection. \n\n1 MS notes in the departmental file. \n2 <i>Letters addressed to Sir ]oseph Williamson While Plenipotentiary at the Congress in Cologne\u20261673 and 1674</i>, ed.
