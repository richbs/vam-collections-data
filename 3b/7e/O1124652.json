Their shoes are designed to allow for growth and to prevent damage to children\u2019s feet, by incorporating extra supports and numerous width fittings.\n\nThe Start-rite brand name was first used in the early 1920s, and was promoted through colourful and bold advertising campaigns. In the 1920s and 1940s the company commissioned high-profile health inspections to examine children\u2019s feet, and pronounced both times that children\u2019s growth was being stunted and their feet damaged. Throughout the twentieth century, Start-rite shoes were marketed to parents as a healthy, well-fitted investment in their child\u2019s future.\n\nThese shoes were worn by a child called Stephen, who was born in London in 1957. They were the first shoes he wore once he learned to walk.",
