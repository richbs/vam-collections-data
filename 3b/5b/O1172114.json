It would have been designed to display on record shop counters or walls to bring attention to the new release. The shield design of this standee invokes the label that Deaf School were signed to - WEA (Warner Elektra Atlantic) Records. It alludes to the icon of the Warner Bros. company used in its films and cartoons. \n\nDeaf School formed in 1974, hailing from Liverpool, with a style that combined art rock with Music Hall style theatrics. In 1976 they won a rock contest organised by the music weekly Melody Maker, the prize of which was a recording deal with WEA Records. They split up after three albums, having never quite hit the big time, but their underground popularity, particularly in Liverpool, has allowed them several reunion tours since 1978.",
