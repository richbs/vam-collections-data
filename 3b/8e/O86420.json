They were billed as \u2018Roze and Calvert. Comedy Artistes\u2019. This is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums. Frank and Roze were on the same bill that week as Harry Bedford and R. A. Roberts, who were also drawn by Cooke.\n\nFrank Calvert is portrayed here as the cheroot-smoking Captain Kettle, in a burlesque version of the play Captain Kettle. This was based on the stories of C. J. Cutcliffe Hyne, which were first published in book form in 1898, and seen in a stage adaptation at the Adelphi Theatre in London in 1902. About 1900, the published stories of Captain Kettle and his unethical deeds at sea rivalled the selling power of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s tales of Sherlock Holmes. But Captain Kettle\u2019s fame has proved less enduring.",
