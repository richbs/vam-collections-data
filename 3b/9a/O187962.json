It is also known by many other names including fivestones, knucklebones and dibs. The game is simple to learn and can be played anywhere there is a hard, flat surface such as the playground or on the floor at home. There are several variations on the rules of the game but the general aim is to pick up as many jacks as possible before the ball bounces. Some rules allow the ball to bounce once making it easier to pick up the jacks.\n\nThis set of jacks is made from metal, although in the past they were made from a variety of materials or found objects like small stones, clay, and pieces of bone. Today they are commonly made from plastic or metal. The original packaging has been lost so a former owner made a bag from a scrap of material to hold the pieces.",
