These are very early examples of silks woven in Italy. Technically and stylistically, this silk also resembles those woven in Spain at this time. \n\nBoth pattern and technique indicate the early date; the wyvern (a winged two legged dragon), eagles and palmettes are part of the repertoire of design absorbed into Italian silk weaving from the Byzantine and Isalmic Near East and as far away as China in some cases. This may have come from an ecclesiastical source, from which most early textiles survive, but silks like these were also used for dress and furnishings.",

These are very early examples of silks woven in Italy or Spain. A similar piece in the collections of the Abegg-Stiftung in Switzerland (inv. no. 202) has been attributed to Spain on stylistic and technical grounds, and a fragment of the same silk in the Mus\u00e9e des Tissus in Lyon was bought in Spain in 1904. (Otavsky, Karel. <i>Mittelalterliche Textilien I</i>. Riggisberg: Abegg-Stiftung, 1995, no. 93, pp. 169-71).\n\nBoth pattern and technique indicate the early date; the wyvern (a winged two legged dragon), eagles and palmettes are part of the repertoire of design absorbed into Italian silk weaving from the Byzantine and Isalmic Near East and as far away as China in some cases. This may have come from an ecclesiastical source, from which most early textiles survive, but silks like these were also used for dress and furnishings.",
