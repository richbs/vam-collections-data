            "historical_context_note": "This drawing is executed in a freer style compare to the other drawings by Delaune in the collection, and is close in style to a series of drawings in the Albertina: <i>Diverses Actions pastorales et champ\u00eatres</i> (pen, ink and wash on vellum, 4.5 x 3.7 cm \u2013 Inv. No. 24230 to 24234). \n\nThe allegory of Faith is similar with minor variations to the allegory of Faith surmounting the cartouche of the <i>Destruction of the Pharoah\u2019s Army</i> by Delaune in the Getty Museum, Los Angeles (Inv. No. 91.GG.76). The four allegories and the two alternative designs for the spaces between the cartouches, respectively a satyr\u2019s mask and a crouching putto amongst fruit and foliage, are characteristic of the School of Fontainebleau imagery.  \n\nAlthough this drawing appears very close to Delaune\u2019s manner, it is different from comparable circular designs. The three designs for tazza bowls in the Louvre (Inventaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, Ecole fran\u00e7aise, V, no. 3544-3546) appear more refined and executed with a higher degree of finish. For all three, the spaces between the cartouches are filled up with 4 different grotesques with strapwork, fruits and foliage, while the centre is also decorated. This drawing was made on paper, a rare artistic practice for Delaune who tend to exclusively use vellum (with an exception for bigger formats). JF Haywards retained that \u2018the restrained use of strapwork suggests the later Fontainebleau manner\u2019.\nThis design does not seem to have been subsequently engraved.",
