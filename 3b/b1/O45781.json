People were encouraged to give public expression to their grief, and an industry of mourning dress and mementoes provided visible reminders of the dead.\n\nThis memorial card commemorates three children who were killed by their parents. The private catastrophe caused a public outpouring of communal feeling, and people packed the court room during the murder trail. The inscription suggests that it was printed for general consumption.",
