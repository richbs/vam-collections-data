Feline served his apprenticeship with Augustine Courtauld from 1709 and established his own workshop in Rose Street, Covent Garden in 1720. Feline made a table centrepiece for the Williams family of Bodelwyddan, Clwyd, now in the National Museum of Wales and a Christening bowl and cover as George II's present to his goddaughter Lady Emilia Lennox, daughter of the Duke of Richmond in 1731\n\nHistorical significance: When St. George's Hospital opened in 1733 Richard Willis, Bishop of Winchester was elected President. Hospital governors recognised the importance of religion in educating and nurturing those for whom they cared. Regular communion was seen as part of the healing process. By 1772, Maitland recorded in his History of London, II, p.1504 'Prayers are read daily to the Patients. A Sermon is preached every Sunday, the Communion is adminstered every Month and the Chaplain attends at other times to catechize and to perform other religious offices, as often as their cases require and when the Patients are discharged, religious Tracts are given to each of them for their further Education.'",
