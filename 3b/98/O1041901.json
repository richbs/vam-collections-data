(No. 142 [302-1888]), 1817 (Nos. 156-160 [298-1888, 278-1888, 819-1888, 822-1888, 611-1888]), and also with the two Salisbury sketch-books of 1820 (see note following No. 205 [821-1888]).  Should it come from any of these, that of 1817 is the most likely source.  Holmes, p. 244, compares the drawing with the oil sketch No. 112 [130-1888], which he lists under the year 1819, but he may only be comparing the subject matter.",
