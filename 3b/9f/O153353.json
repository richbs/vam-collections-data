Gramberg regards it as a bronze replica, and Maclagan and Longhurst (p. 142) suggest that it might be a comparatively recent casting. \nThe relief is of some age, and is perhaps an old cast from a superior bronze or marble original.\n\nPiero da Vinci (ca. 1529 - 1553) was an Italian sculptor and the nephew of Leonardo da Vinci.\nHis short life was characterised by a promising career as sculptor. He began as an apprentice at Baccio Bandinelli's workshop when he was just 12 and was shortly afterwards transferred to the workshop of Niccolo Tribolo. His first works, a series of putti to be dated after 1544 were so similar in style to Tribolo's so to frequently cause misattributions.",
