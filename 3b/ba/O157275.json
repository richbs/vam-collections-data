The person holding most power in a group was provided with the most elaborate chair - sometimes the only chair. This way of marking status continued into the eighteenth century.  Masters of London livery companies - the successors of the trade guilds - used special chairs, large in scale and decorated with motifs of their trades. Local groups of the society known as Freemasons followed the same practice in their clubrooms. The chair of the master of each 'lodge' was distinguished by it size and often by its decoration. This chair is well proportioned and only slightly larger than a standard chair, although some such Masonic chairs were designed with exaggeratedly tall backs.  The motif that identifies this a Masonic chair is the discreet inlay at the top of the splat, which shows a plumb line, used by working masons to find a true vertical.\n\nOn loan to Provost Skeen's House.",
