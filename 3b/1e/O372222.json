The seat rails of the set are arched at the centre and carved with over-scrolled inverted lambrequins framed by acanthus leaves. The cabriole legs have similar motifs above the cambuchons at the knees, the decoration continuing down in trellised, shaped narrow panels, terminating in square acanthus leaf pad feet. \nThe set is covered in a material exactly copied from the original upholstery dating from between 1717 and 1723. It embodies two sorts of silver and two sorts of gold thread on a background of salmon pink silk which shows through the rich brocading to form a delicate linear pattern. \nThe stools are numbered 'XI' and 'XII' on the secondary frame, which runs around the inside edges of the chairs and stools. This frame appears to be contemporary, though it has been strengthened by narrow beading all around, nailed to the frames themselves. Under the stools are labels marked 'North Heirlooms' followed by the number '28' or '29'. Under all the set the walnut frames have a yellow ochre colour where the gesso shows ungilded. The bolus, which shows through the gilding in places, is a brownish red.",
