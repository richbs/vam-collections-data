Examples of the same paper have been found lining an oak chest dating from the second half of the 16th century, and a variation of the pattern was also discovered in a room in the Base Court at Hampton Court Palace. The design is typical of the period; the majority of printed patterned papers from the 16th century have simple repeats based on heraldic motifs. Though this design, and others of this period, show the Arms of England and the royal emblem, the Tudor rose, it does not indicate a direct royal connection. Patterns of this kind were rather intended as an indication of social status, wealth, and position, and a sign of the family's affiliations.",
