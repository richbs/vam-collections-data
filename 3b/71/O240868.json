            "public_access_description": "Mary Frank was born in London in 1933 and moved to the United States at the age of seven. In the early 1950s she began carving wood sculpture, and briefly studied with Hans Hoffman and Max Beckmann. In 1969, she worked on large multi-part, figurative clay sculptures, drawings and monoprints, which remained the major focus of her work throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s, she turned to painting as her primary medium.\n\nHer paintings and prints often begin as abstractions of dark and light, of swirling and still elements. Gradually they focus on a specific person, event, or place, slowly evolving as the artist creates, in her words, \"a pre-existing time and atmosphere where events can take place.\" The recurring imagery of trees, owls, ships, chasms in the earth, and human figures running, leaping, crouching, and gazing at the whirlwind surrounding them becomes a means of communicating grief and love, sorrow and ecstasy, mourning and exultation. Consequently, there is a narrative within each piece and also within the entire body of work as the imagery reverberates and creates a cumulative effect.",
