It features a line drawing of Beatrice Lillie, the stage and screen actress best known for her trademark long cigarette holder, short black hair and close-fitting cap.  Beatrice Lillie was once hailed as 'the toast of two continents'  but was especially loved in Great Britain where she first came in 1914 and took part in several of Andr\u00e9 Charlot's popular sophisticated revues. She made her Broadway d\u00e9but in 1924 in Andr\u00e9 Charlot's Revue, when a six-week booking was extended to nine months, and co-starred with Noel Coward in the 1928 production of  his own revue This Year of Grace.\n\nThe drawing reproduced on this tile is by the great American theatrical caricature artist, Al Hirschfeld (1903-2003) who had an extremely long and successful career as a stage caricature artist.  After studying art, and becoming an art director in the cinema industry at an extremely young age, Hirschfeld made a career as an artist of theatrical drawings. His drawings were published in the New York Times for over 70 years.  They chart the stars of American theatre from the 1930s until the turn of the 21st century.",
