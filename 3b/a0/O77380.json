Lahore, the capital of the Mughal province of Punjab, was a renowned centre for the manufacture of armour and weapons. It would later be divided at Partition in 1947 between the newly formed nations of Pakistan and India.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis helmet is made from the watered steel for which the Indian subcontinent has been famous for centuries. The distinctive, though discreet, pattern of dark whorls on a paler ground is produced by the variations in colour of the different elements of the crystalline structure of the steel. This has been partly concealed by the application of brown lac (a natural resin from which sealing wax was also made), possibly suggesting that the bowl of the helmet was an old piece that was splendidly refurbished for the Great Exhibition. The gold overlaid ornament would also have been newly applied for the Exhibition, and a new mail neck guard, solid neck guard and plume holders were added.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThe helmet was bought by the Museum of Ornamental Art from the Great Exhibition of 1851 as a modern piece from Lahore. It cost \u00a313 2s 6d.",
