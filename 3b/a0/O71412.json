The costume consists of a dark green bodice with long grey sleeves, and a dark green crinoline skirt which ends above the ankles and is decorated with a fringed zig-zag pattern at the hem.  The figure also wears a lace cap, grey tights, and black shoes.  To the right of the figure, the artist has glued a photocopy of a drawing of a mid 19th century lace cap, and a photocopy of a black and white photograph showing the hem of a crinoline skirt.  Printed graphics for \"The Brontes\" and \"Northern Ballet Theatre\" have been glued by the artist into the corners of the design.  The design has also been stamped by the \"Society of British Theatre Designers\", and \"Mayer and Eden\".  Unsigned by the artist.  On the reverse is a pencil drawing of a female figure.",
