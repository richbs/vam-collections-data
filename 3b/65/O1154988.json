Long legs and a white tie! (white tie) oh!'\n\nG.H. Chirgwin was a talented musician who played a variety of stringed instruments and was well known for playing the 'Jap fiddle', the one-stringed instrument depicted here, named after its similarity to the Japanese instrument the koky\u016b. The 'Jap fiddle' was popular with street performers, music hall performers and vaudevillians in the United Kingdom and the USA in the early 20th century.",
