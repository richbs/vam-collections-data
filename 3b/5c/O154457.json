The handle is fluted over two thirds of its forward length and terminates in a heavy, square capital, from which a finely peened, star burst, quarter round finial button protrudes.  The junction end of the handle is surmounted by a ferocious winged dragon whose tail writhes back over and along the column and whose claws scar the round that holds the blade.",
