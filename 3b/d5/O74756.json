He has used some elements based on 18th century examples, but the shapes of the body and spout and the quirkiness of the handle show his originality. The brief but informative construction notes are accompanied by little sketches showing the details of the mouldings and the feet. This is typical of his work. Webb's drawings left nothing to chance and he always included as much detail as he could.",
