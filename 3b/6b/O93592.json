Holmes, p. 239, assigns the Museum's drawing to 1804; Shirley (L. ed. S., p. 35) to 1806. For a discussion of the influence of Frost on Constable, with a number of comparative illustrations, see 'The Drawings of George Frost, 1745-1821' by John Hayes, <i>Master Drawings</i>, Vol. 4, No. 2, 1966, esp. pp. 166-8. Hayes considers that the results of Constable's imitation of Frost are to be seen most clearly in 1802, eg. in No. 38 [841-1888].",
