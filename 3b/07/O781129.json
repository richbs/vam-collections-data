            "public_access_description": "The Engraved Passion (1507-1512) was one of four major series of religious prints made by D\u00fcrer, and helped to establish his reputation as an outstanding Renaissance printmaker. The others were the woodcut series of the Life of the Virgin, the Great Passion, and the Little Passion, all published in 1511. The Engraved Passion consists of fifteen small scale engravings and tells the story of Christ's betrayal by Judas, his crucifixion and resurrection. D\u00fcrer is renowned for inventing new and imaginative ways to depict scenes from Christian stories, and in the Engraved Passion the compositions of each plate are dramatic, intricate and complex, with emotive contrasts of light and shadow. Unlike the more populist woodcut prints, they were designed to appeal to a more exclusive market of connoisseurs and collectors. Because it took several years for the series to be completed, it is likely that individual images were sold separately. The series was also sold in sets for devotional use, and was widely copied by other printmakers and in other media.",

However, it is not part of the Passion story, and can best be explained as a transitional subject for a planned series on the Apostles. The cripple is afflicted with leprosy. St. John, in the right background, closely resembles the representation in \"The Crucifixion\" (.013), whereas his counterpart, on the extreme left, was presumably inspired by a well-known medal of John Paleologus. St. Peter's garment is based on a preparatory drawing for the \"Heller Altarpiece\" (SD.1508/1). The architectural backdrop is closely akin to that of \"Christ Crowned with Thorns\" (.009). Beenken suggested that this engraving perhaps derives from Masaccio's fresco \"The Tribute Money\" in the Brancacci Chapel in Florence.'\n\nStrauss, Walter L., ed. <u>The Illustrated Bartsch 10 (Commentary): Sixteenth Century German Artists, Albrecht D\u00fcrer</u>.
