Coral branches were often left in a natural state for amulets, but beads for necklaces or earrings, as here, were always shaped.  \n\nThis earring was bought for \u00a31 4s (the pair) as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.\n.",
