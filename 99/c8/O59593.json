W.1A-1988) are mentioned in the 1740 inventory of the contents of Tottenham Park, described as 'ten poettes heads on painted and gilt brackets (one ditto of Mr. Pope)'.\n\nDesign\nThey are carved in imitation of stone and enriched with water gilding. The upper edge of the plinth has a cyma reversa moulding - that is a moulding that is convex in its upper part and concave below. The plinths are supported by  scroll-shaped brackets decorated  with a bead and reel moulding flanked by outward-facing cyma reversa borders. The C-scroll pendant frames an acanthus leaf.\n\nMaterials & Making\nWater gilding gives a particularly bright and shiny effect, unlike oil gilding which is duller. In water gilding, the base coat (a reddish clay known as 'bole') is moistened with water before the gold leaf is applied. When the work is dry the gold is burnished with a special tool.  \n\nPeople\nRichard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, was the chief proponent of the Palladian style. He designed Tottenham Park, Wiltshire,  from 1721, adding  four corner pavilions in 1738. The house belonged to Charles, Viscount Bruce who had married Burlington's sister, Juliana,  in 1719. It was Burlington's first architectural commission and launched his career as an architect. \n\nThe interior furnishings were designed by William Kent.",
