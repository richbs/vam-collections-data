His watercolour drawing was particularly attractive, and his pattern designs were less eccentric than those of his teacher A. H. Mackmurdo. They were in partnership from 1885-1890.\nThis wallpaper pattern is deceptively simple. It is not as well known as his `Angel with Trumpet' design for printed cotton. However, it does show his skill in making a new kind of pattern out of traditional floral shapes. The wallpaper was printed by Jeffrey & Co of Islington, London, who also produced the wallpapers designed by William Morris.",
