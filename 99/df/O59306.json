The proof illustration is E.789-1998.\n\nThe designs in the group to which this design belongs (E.650-661-1998) are very close in date.  The date range is November 1847 - April 1848.  Some of the designs are only a day apart and this fact supports the physical evidence that they were once bound in a sketchbook.",
