            "public_access_description": "Claudia Casarino lives and works in Paraguay. She has long been interested in water and its effects on the body \u2013 nourishing, sensual and cleansing. She describes water as a cage that frees the naked body from the world around it. At the same time she is interested in the way the female body has been treated in the popular press, the way it has expressed male fantasy and desire rather than a more prosaic reality of womanhood. \n\nDuring a residency in London in 2004 Casarino began to make a series of drawings of the female body. She took photographs of herself, enlarged them, then traced the outline of the figure onto tracing paper with water. The female figure is shown in private situations that are to do with self-image. Here the figure shaves her legs \u2013 a process that is cleansing but also a way in which she ties herself to an idealised form. To Casarino the rites and routines of self-enhancement nearly cause the real woman to disappear. She notes that historically women have rarely been represented as themselves and have disappeared under layers of make-up or garments. By using water to define the body, Casarino delicately underscores this invisibility.",
