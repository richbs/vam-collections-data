Innovative methods of kiln design such as the 'climbing kilns' and new production techniques were introduced around Japan, with new kilns sites such as Tateno and Ryummonji being built. Kilns such as Ryumonji, constructed around 1598, produced early Satsuma pieces as exemplified by this piece, to elegantly simple utilitarian pieces for the home, shop or inn. This sake bottle had to be both aesthetically pleasing and robust. The wide base of the vessel together with its delicately curved form, rising to an elegant elongated neck, provided the perfect combination of rustic style and practicality. The deep brown colouration together with the rough surface of the vessel was due to the iron-rich soil of the region that created a much admired warm hue.",
