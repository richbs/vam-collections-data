This fragment was from the centre of the dish. A blunt point was used to incise the lines and to create the shading on the leaf and bud.\n\nIf the dish had not been damaged in the kiln, the decoration would have then been enhanced with colours made from oxides. Colours, when painted on the shaded areas, would have created a strong contrast to the also coloured but non-shaded areas.",
