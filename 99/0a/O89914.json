The points and the border surrounds are painted with designs of arabesques and grotesques. \nIn the centre of the two tables are six pierced white amber reliefs set in horn, or perhaps foil painted black; these show six scenes from the myth of Phaethon. They show: Phaeton approaching Apollo, Phaeton driving the chariot Phaeton plunging to his death, Phaeton's sisters. \nThe raised borders of the board are decorated scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses: Perseus beheading Medusa, Apollo and Daphne, Pluto and Proserpine, Meleager and Atlanta, the birth of Adonis and Apollo killing Python.\nThe seven virtues are represented at seven of the corners, the eighth being occupied by an unidentified female figure.",

A comparison with similar gamesboards suggests that originally amber was originally inlaid on the external as well as the internal surfaces; the outer decoration is now lost. Gamesboards such as this were produced in K\u00f6nigsberg (then in Prussia), as well as in other Baltic cities. The myth of Phaeton depicted here in one of the small reliefs is eminently suitable for an amber piece. In Ovid's version of the story, Phaeton was the son Apollo, the sun-god, whom he asked to drive his chariot of the sun across the heavens. Apollo yielded and Phaeton was too weak to check the horses, and plunged so near to earth that he almost set it on fire. Zeus therefore had to kill him with a flash of lightning, so that he fell into the river Eridanus. His mourning sisters wept so much that they were metamorphosed into poplars, and their tears turned into amber.",
