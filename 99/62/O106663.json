            "public_access_description": "Venus the Roman goddess of love and fertility, was the mother of Cupid, the god of Love. The figures are seated on doplphins, referring to the birth of Venus from the sea.\n\nCupid is usually represented as a boy, often with the attributes bow, arrow and quiver.\n\nThe sculptor Francesco Fanelli was first documented in Genoa in 1608, where, until about 1631, he produced religious works in marble, silver, ivory and bronze. By 1635, he was working at the English court. Although he described himself 'sculptor to the King of Great Britain', it is unclear whether this title was officially conferred. The V&A owns versions of several small bronzes by 'ffrancisco the one-eyed Italian' listed in an inventory of Whitehall Palace in 1639. George Vertue stated that Fanelli 'lv'd and dyd in England'; he is last documented in 1641 and believed to have died soon after.",
