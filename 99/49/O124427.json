The trade card is stuck into the middle of the first folio of an album of designs, and the  inscription is written on the page below it. The designs in the album date from about 1735-1820 and include those for snuffboxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, small swords, and chatelaines (ornamental chains, pins, or clasps usually worn at a woman's waist, to which trinkets, keys, purses, or other articles are attached).  The binding is red morocco and the boards are stamped in gilt with the arms, now partly erased, of a member of the Bourbon family, probably Louis-Henri, Prince of Cond\u00e9 (1692-1740).\n\nDucrollay, Drais and Ouizille formed a series of connected partnerships. Jean Ducrollay (1710-1787) became a master in 1734 and is believed to have retired in 1761.  He was succeeeded by Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Drais, (1726-1788), his cousin and one of his 'chefs d'atelier'. Drais became a master in 1763, jeweller to the King  in 1770, and then worked until his death in 1788.  In 1786 Drais became associated with Charles Ouizille (1744-1830). Ouizille, who had become master in 1771, became one of  the King's jewellers in 1784.  In 1816 he formed a partnership with Adrien-Jean-Maximilien Vachette (also a royal jeweller) and in 1820 with Petitjean. \n\nThe close relationship between the contents of the album and known work by the three goldsmiths supports the idea that the material emanates from their workshops, as is suggested by this trade card on the first page. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.",
