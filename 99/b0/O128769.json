            "public_access_description": "This dagger hilt of pale green nephrite jade was probably made for a member of the Mughal court in the mid-17th century. It would originally have been set with precious stones, but these have been gouged out, making it possible to see an earlier stage in the complicated process of decorating jade artefacts. The original design would have consisted of flower heads set with stones such as diamonds, emeralds and rubies in gold. The gold used in Indian jewellery and jewelled artefacts is highly refined and extremely soft, enabling the craftsman to fashion the setting using tools but no heat. When decorating jade, the elements of the design to be set with stones would be deeply cut and then straight lines, as seen on this piece, or drilled dots, would be made at the base of the cavities to enable gold to adhere to the smooth surface and line the cavity. The stones would then be added. The dagger hilt was in the collection of Sir John Metcalf by 1874.",
