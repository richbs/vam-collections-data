            "public_access_description": "The 'roemer' was the most popular drinking glass for white wine in the seventeenth-century Netherlands. A roemer is made out of green glass and consists of a foot, a hollow shaft, decorated with prunts, and a bowl. Bowl and shaft are blown as one hollow shape and visually separated with a ribbed glass thread around the outside. The prunts on the shaft are decorative but also provide a good grip. Roemers were imported into the Netherlands from Germany in the ten-thousands but smaller numbers were also produced locally. The typical green tint is caused by iron impurities in the sand used to make the glass. Glass can be decolourised, but the green tint was deemed attractive and ideally suited for drinking white wine, as the colour of the glass gives a golden tint to the wine inside. \nThis roemer is decorated with a suitably jolly scene of dancing peasants and a musician, skilfully scratched into the glass with a diamond-point.",
