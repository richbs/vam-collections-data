Berbers are the indigenous peoples of North Africa west of the Nile Valley. They were living in the region long before the arrival of the Arabs; their culture probably dates back more than 4,000 years. Today, there are substantial Berber populations in Morocco and Algeria, plus smaller numbers in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt.\n\nMuseum documentation records that this Berber anklet came from Algeria and was made before the French occupation of that country, which began in 1830. Berber women\u2019s jewellery was traditionally a source of family wealth. Pieces would be sold in times of hardship and new pieces purchased in times of affluence. As weight carried more importance than workmanship decoration was often kept to a minimum.",
