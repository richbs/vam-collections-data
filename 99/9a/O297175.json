She bases her work on her study of ceramics found in excavations and in public and private collections.  She also uses her knowledge of historic ceramics to make contemporary studio ceramic sculpture, examples of which are in museums and institutions in America and the UK and have featured in American and international publications.\n\n'Octopus Junk' is a contemporary piece inspired by finds excavated from Chinese junks which had sunk in the process of exporting Chinese porcelain to the western world.  Excavated porcelain has sometimes been changed by years at the bottom of the sea, becoming fused with other porcelain pieces as well as natural objects into so-called 'sea sculptures' and it is these which have inspired Michelle Erickson's work.",
