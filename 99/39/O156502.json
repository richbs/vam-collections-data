            "public_access_description": "From about 1745 enamelling dominated the decoration of Paris boxes.  The enamelling was executed straight on to the gold faces of the box.  The boxes ceased to have the curving shapes popular in the 1730s and became rectangular with straight sides. Each face was seen as a complete canvas for the composition.  \n\nAt first floral sprays, animals and birds were the most popular subjects. In the 1750s, pictorial scenes illustrate domestic life based on the work of well known contemporary artists. The miniatures on this box are clearly inspired by the work of the famous French painter Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, they are not however exact copies of his work. The artist who signed them is probably Claude Bornet another eighteenth century French artist active at the Acad\u00e9mie de Saint-Luc and the Salons of the time. \n\nJean Fr\u00e9min became a master goldsmith in 1738. By 1779, he had become the prime warden of the goldsmith\u2019s guild. His success in the profession is demonstrated by an inventory taken after his death in 1786, showing a comfortably furnished apartment with a chest containing silver cups and flatware and his employment of a family of three servants.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.\nOn long-term loan to Los Angeles County Museum from 2010.",
