Cobalt blue was used to decorate some of these ceramics. This pigment had to be imported from China, which made it expensive. As a result, its use was sometimes banned as it represented an extravagance at odds with the austerity of the Confucian values that held sway in the Choson period. Generally, blue and white ceramics were used in households of the upper echelons of society: at court and among the literati.\n\nTwo characters have been painted onto the exterior surface of this bowl in cobalt blue. These are 'pok' meaning happiness and 'su' meaning long life.",
