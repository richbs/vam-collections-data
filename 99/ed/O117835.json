Born into a Jewish family in Frankfurt, she initially pursued an academic career before moving to Paris in 1930 to concentrate on photography.\n\nBing liked to remove objects from their context, focusing on the abstract, expressive qualities that materialised in her photographs. The Surrealists called this effect \u2018d\u00e9paysement\u2019 (removal from the natural sphere). \u2018Things that are related and everyday are also related to something beyond, something you cannot catch\u2019, Bing once said. Here the music stands, photographed before the performance of Balanchine's Errante, appear as dancing shapes, floating in the darkness of the theatre. The year she made this photograph, Bing met her husband, the concert pianist Konrad Wolff. He lived downstairs from her flat at 8, rue de Varenne, and his music drifted through the building.",
