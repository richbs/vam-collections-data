The body is decorated with a minute design of stylised dragons and cloud scrolls in horizontal bands that were incised on the body before the yellow glaze was applied. \n\nThe peculiar shape of this vessel imitates that of an ancient bronze vessel (called a he in Chinese) produced in China between the 7th and the 6th century BC, and used to hold alcohol. The reproduction of an archaic form denotes a taste for antiquities, which was quite popular among the \u00e9lites in China during the 18th century. Despite the use of the yellow colour, which is usually associated to the emperor, this vessel was not probably intended for court circles.",
