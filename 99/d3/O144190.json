Central panel with a multi-petalled flower head in the centre with a straight stem emerging above and below on which are other, smaller flower heads.  Short sprigs and flowers and buds also come from the central flower.  This is all contained by a fine undulating line.  Thicker lines form a lobed ogival compartment around this and to the outer edge of a border pattern of a stem with narrow-petalled flower heads, the thicker lines extend to form an empty pendant at the top and bottom. The rest of the central panel is covered with coiling stems bearing stylized flowers and leaves.  Inner and outer border: missing from the top where the textile has been cut across the width.  Heavy disjointed stems with either a pair of flower or a single flower; these alternate.  Usually the pair of flowers point inward.\nMain border: missing from the top.  wide border.  A line of star like flowers with a pair of curving stems coming from the sides and curving first in and then out, ending in feathery leaves.  These were block-printed and there are many mistakes especially along the lower part of the borders where incomplete motifs and overlapping motifs compete for space.\nEmbroidery thread: unplied silk: predominantly shades of pink but also purple, light purple, orange, yellow, dark pink, pink, light pink, dark blue, blue, light blue, dark red [only in one area].\nMetal thread: silver strip close Z-bound on yellow silk; there is also gilt or possibly silver-gilt strip but this is best seen in 'knots' on the back of the fabric.",
