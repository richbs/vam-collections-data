Ruoppolo may have trained under the influence of Paolo Porpora (1617-1670/80) and Luca Forte (ca.1615-1670). He ran an important studio in Naples and had many followers. \n\nThis painting is most likely the work of a follower of Giovanni Battista Ruoppolo, one of the leading still-life painters in Naples during the second half of the 17th century. The picture shows two large melons surrounded by peaches, plums and green and purple figs in varying stages of ripeness, while in the background one can distinguish a patch of atmospheric sky. Still-lifes usually bear a symbolic meaning that reminds by contrast the passing of the time and the eminence of death. Called 'memento mori', these pictures can be enriched with skulls or precious items, a trend that would flourished during the Baroque period.",

Before 1800,</u> London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 200, cat. no. 243.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nNEAPOLITAN School, 17th century \n\n243 \nSTILL LIFE: MELONS AND FIGS \nCanvas \n19 \u00bc x 25 \u00bd (49 x 64.7) \nP.47-1962\nAccording to an old label on the back, this painting was formerly attributed to Michelangelo di Campidoglio (Rome, 1610-70), whose name was frequently used in England to describe a wide variety of 17th century Italian still life paintings (G. De Logu, <i>Natura morta italiana,</i> 1962, p. 189). More recently it has been attributed to Gian Battista Ruoppolo (Naples, 1629-93), and as such it entered the Museum in the Rotch bequest. However, it does not approach the quality of the authenticated works of G. B. Ruoppolo and a more general attribution to the school of Naples seems more fitting. \n\nProv. Claude D.

The strong chiaroscuro, indebted to Caravaggio, suggests an awareness of still ife paintings from Rome.\n\nAccording to an old label on the back, it was formerly attributed to Michelangelo di Campidoglio (Rome, 1610-70), whose name was frequently used in England to describe a wide variety of 17th century Italian still life paintings (G. De Logu, <i>Natura morta italiana,</i> 1962, p. 189). More recently it has been attributed to Gian Battista Ruoppolo (Naples, 1629-93), and as such it entered the Museum in the Rotch bequest. Its naturalistic composition lacks the lavish decoration typical of Ruoppolo's later manner.\n\nThe painting resembles works from Ruppolo's studio, such as <i>Grapes and Peaches</i>, and <i>Grapes and various fruits</i>, both in the Pinacoteca d'Errico, Matera, and may be by a close follower or assistant.",

The term conventionally refers to the type of work in which an arrangement of diverse inanimate objects including fruits and shellfishes, vessels and artefacts are depicted, sometimes charged with symbolic meaning. This new genre painting originated in Flanders, and  was introduced from Flanders and Spain to Italy, where it also flourished during the 17th century.\n\nThis work was formerly attributed to Michelangelo di Campidoglio (Rome, 1610-70), but more closely resembles the style of the Neapolitan Giovanni Battista Ruoppolo, while lacking the quality of his autograph work. Ruppolo was a successful still-life painter whose pictures were collected by the aristocracy and wealthy merchant classes. He had many followers.",
