They belonged to a family of hereditary rulers of the province of Thatta. Mirza Jani submitted to the Mughal army under Akbar (r. 1656-1605) and became a loyal supporter of the emperor. His son was equally loyal to Jahangir and led the Mughal army in major campaigns in the early years of his reign. He was also a poet whose Persian verses the emperor greatly admired.  Mirza Ghazi died in 1612.\nManohar had worked in the imperial ateliers for Akbar, and became one of Jahangir's greatest artists.\nHis portrait of Mirza Ghazi was copied exactly for a scene of Jahangir in a garden, surrounded by members of his court, also in the V&A (IM.9-1925).",
