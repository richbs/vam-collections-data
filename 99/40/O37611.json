Early Chinese Art, Cunliffe Collection, London, 1973, No. 104, pl. XXXI\nDating of such small animal carvings remains problematical in the absence of excavated evidence.  Recent Chinese research, however, indicates that the majority of such pieces are unlikely to be earlier than Ming dynasty in date.",
