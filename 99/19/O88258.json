He was also closely involved in publicising and promoting the binomial system of plant classification that was devised by the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus.\n\nEhret painted this plant study in the 1740s, at the height of his mature style. We do not know the precise date, but a near identical version is dated 1745. In the text Ehret notes that \u2018this lily first flowered in August 1738\u2019, in the garden of Peter Collinson. Collinson was an avid collector of new plants, and lived just outside London. Ehret often studied plants in his collection. Dr C. J. Trew reproduced a version of this picture in his book Plantae Selectae, which he published in Nuremberg between 1750 and 1773.",

Though Ehret had worked with Linnaeus since the late 1730s when they collaborated on the 'Hortus Cliffortianus' (1737) the caption to this picture does not use the Linnaean binomial system but prefers the older, discredited method of using a string of descriptive Latin terms. However the Swedish botanist's influence is evident in the character of the illustration. The Linnaean system depended on the flower and an enumeration of the stamens and pistils, and their relation to one another. Thus Ehret has chosen to show only the flower-spike, ignoring the rest of the plant; the flowers themselves are painted in almost 'trompe l'oeil' detail, from every angle, and in bud and full bloom. It is thus perfectly possible to classify this plant without ever seeing the thing itself.\n\nIn addition to the plant's descriptive name, Ehret includes a lengthy Latin description about the plant and the circumstances in which he studied it. He notes that 'this lily first flowered in August 1738, in the garden of Peter Collinson', an avid collector of new plants. It is not clear precisely when this finished portrait was made; this version is undated, but a near identicl plate which appeared at Christie's in 1994 is signed and dated 1745. Ehret often made copies of his more successful compositions, as commissions or gifts. One version of this was certainly sent to C.J.
