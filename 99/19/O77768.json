As with many of his contemporaries, Rudolphi was particularly interested in surface treatment, and this vase is oxydised and parcel-gilt (partly gilded). Rudolphi's designs were eclectic, drawing on a number of stylistic sources that included Oriental, Renaissance and Gothic art.\n\nHistorical Association\nThis vase was selected for the government-sponsored Schools of Design by Charles Heath Wilson, a leading figure in design education, who was Director of the School of Design in London from 1843 to 1847.  In this capacity he made a number of purchases of objects for the Schools of Design Collection, which were to form the core of the Museum of Ornamental Art, later the South Kensington Museum, which in turn became the Victoria & Albert Museum. This vase was purchased for \u00a340 and is one of the Museum's earliest acquisitions. It demonstrates not only Britain's acknowledgement of the continuing high quality of workmanship and the inventiveness of design in the French decorative arts, but the perceived need for British goldsmiths and designers to improve their skills by studying the best French examples.",
