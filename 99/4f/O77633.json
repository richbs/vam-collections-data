Kilns in that region were famous for their vessels and especially their figurines, made from the 16th century onwards. The porcelains were made for a fairly local, domestic market but were also exported to Europe in some numbers from the 17th century. \n\nSubjects Depicted\nThis particular figure shows the Buddhist divinity Guanyin, seated on a pedestal with a flowering lotus beneath and holding a lotus bud in her left hand. At her hand is a small boy. These attributes show the deity in her role as the 'sender of sons'.\n\nManufacture\nThe figures were mass-produced using moulds, though the fine detail was finished by hand.  Heads and hands were generally modelled separately and attached to the figure before firing.  When the modelling was complete, the figures were glazed and then fired in a single high-temperature firing.  The work was carried out in family-run workshops.  Dehua figurines are often signed by the potters who made them.",
