The most important is a painting on canvas in the Palazzo Spada, Rome, which was show by Voss to be Perino\u2019s Model for a tapestry commissioned by Paul III as a basamento for Michelangelo\u2019s Last Judgement in the Sistine Chapel. See Voss, Sp\u00e4trenaissance, pp. 72-4, where the Spada Palace painting and a drawing connected with it in the Uffizi are reproduced. Our drawing is close to Perino in handling, possibly by him. Another version of the same design, not so like Perino, is no. 371.",
