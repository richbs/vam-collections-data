            "public_access_description": "Dans-ez was founded in 1975 by former principal dancer Alan Bergman. The Company philosophy is to strive for excellence in design and production and to provide this at a price that is affordable. The brand was one of the first to promote undergarments for sport, emphasising excellence in design, creative innovation and advanced technology. \n\nThis elasticised cotton bra sports top has been specifically formulated for ease of movement and comfort during exercise, with a low cut back that does not show under most sports clothing. The soft cotton and lycra shoulder straps should not slip off the shoulder or dig in and the unique cupless design was innovated to minimise painful breast bounce during exercise and the irreversible stretching of Cooper's ligaments. The extended midriff was designed this way in order to prevent the top from riding up and thus causing discomfort - there are no hooks, wires, clasps, or fasteners incorporated into the design for the same reason. Considering its purpose as a sports bra, no nylon has been used in its construction, only absorbent cotton, a material which allows the skin to breathe easily and is also quick-drying, thus helping the wearer to stay cool. This 2006 design differs little from the original Minimal Bounce Bra launched by Bergman in Britain the early 1970s.",
