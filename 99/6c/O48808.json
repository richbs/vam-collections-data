He wears a white suit trimmed with silver leather braid on the collar and cuffs, and a snakeskin-style waistcoat over a black shirt.  A chorus of dancers all doing a similar dance move appears below and behind the central figure. Black lettering above the image gives the name of the producer; the title and the quote 'A Sensational Night Out', whilst the details of the production team are in white lettering at the bottom left of the poster, with the name of the theatre in red lettering, bottom right.  The central image is surrounded by the four quotes: 'Foot-tapping, hip-swaying, finger-snapping'; 'Hot stuff'; 'Fever is still infectious' and 'You should be dancing', arranged as if emanating from the figure along the rays of light.",
