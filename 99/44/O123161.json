It has become a popular subject for artistic interpretation as it combines the dramatic themes of love and betrayal. Samson, the Jewish hero, fell in love with Delila who is bribed by the philistines to betray hime into their hands. She discovers that his incredible strength comes from his uncut hair whereupon she arranges for it to be cut whilst he sleeps. Samson, drained of his strength, is thus captured by the Philistines  This painting is a copy after a work by Anthony Van Dyck and depicts the moment immediately before Samson's hair is shorn. Van Dyck's picture was probably painted about1619-20, while he was working in the studio of Peter Paul Rubens. The composition derives from Rubens's treatment of the subject in the National Gallery, London of about1609, but the composition is reversed and is therefore probably taken from the print by Jacob Matham.",
