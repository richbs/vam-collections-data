This print evokes the qualities of a photographic negative, with its white line drawing on a dark ground that nevertheless has a luminous tonal range. This ground has been achieved by 'rainbow' printing, a seamless modulation of colour from top to bottom of the image, a process that became popular with American West Coast 'psychedelic' artists 20 years later. The process known as automatic drawing, popular among the Surrealists and prompted by psychoanalytical experiments, has also been brought into play in this image.",

            "bibliography": "Timmers, Margaret (ed), <i>Impressions of the Twentieth Century: Fine Art Prints from the V&A's Collection</i>, London, V&A Publications, 2001\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>Man Ray</b> \n\n<i>Roman noir</i> (Dark Fiction), 1948 \n\nA V&A curator visited Man Ray at his famous Paris studio at 2 <i>bis</i> Rue Ferou, and acquired this print (for \u00a35) with two sets of a portfolio of twelve Rayographs, plus an etching and a zincograph.  The Rayographs (or photograms - photographs made, without a camera, by exposing objects on photographic paper to the light and then developing them) had been published in a limited edition of twenty copies in 1963.  The acquisition rightly suggests Man Ray's pre-eminence as a photographer as well as emphasizing his interest in exploring many other media.  His range as a printmaker included aquatints, too, but his oeuvre, as an artist, was even more various.  He made inspired use of painting, construction, ready-mades and book illustration, as well as being an inventive and resourceful experimenter with photography and film.  He spoke and wrote pithily on aesthetics.  In a volume devoted to his graphic art, published in 1973, Man Ray addressed the question of 'ORIGINALS GRAPHICS MULTIPLES': \n<i>An original is a creation motivated by desire.  Any reproduction of an original is motivated by necessity.  The original is the result of an automatic mental process, the reproduction of a mechanical process.  In other words: Inspiration then information; each validates the other.  All other considerations are beyond the scope of three statements.  It is marvellous that we are the only species that creates gratuitous forms.  To create is divine, to reproduce is human.</i> \nHis prints range over many styles, mainly within the Ecole de Paris (experimental Parisian painting based on post-Cubist styles), although this print was made during Man Ray's years in Hollywood, 1940-51.  <i>Roman noir</i> reflects the Surrealists' interest in automatic drawing and may reflect the works in his genre by Andr\u00e9 Masson (whom Man Ray photographed in the 1920s).  The dark tale drawn here is replete with random lines and fleeting forms that resolve briefly into the limbs of trees and women.  Erotic metamorphoses are played out under a symbolic sun.  Man Ray used a technique called 'rainbow printing': the colour modulates from top to base, from black through violet, deep brown, terracotta to deep brown again.  The technique became characteristic of American West Coast psychedelia twenty years later.\"",
