His paintings evoke an arcadia of shepherds and flocks, rustic dances, and episodes from myth, legend or the Old Testament, all bathed in a nostalgic golden light. Claude also made many sketches, such as this one, in the countryside around Rome. This attractive study, spontaneously dashed off on a scrap of rough blue paper, passed through the hands of many important collectors. Bought by the collector C.A. Ionides as by Claude, it and a similar drawing were later re-attributed to Claude's contemporary, Giovanni-Francesco Grimaldi, 'Il Bolognese' (1606-80). Recently, the other sheet has been given back to Claude. Ionides liked drawings of gnarled trees and also owned several similar subjects by English and Dutch artists.",
