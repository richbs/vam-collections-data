Haute couture designers enjoyed making two dresses in one. Here the front skirt is short, reaching lower calf level. At the back the skirt is long and forms an impressive train that sweeps the floor. The designer has used stiffening bands inside the neck and hem to keep the shape of the dress. The dress fastens with a zip at the back.",

            "bibliography": "Mendes, Valerie. <u>Black In Fashion</u>. London: V&A Publications, 1999, p.67\nBlack was of enormous significance to Christian Dior.  He described it as 'the most popular and the most convenient and the most elegant of all colours.  And I say colour on purpose, because black may be sometimes just as striking as a colour' (Christian Dior's Little Dictionary of Fashion, 1954).  Black was rarely absent from his collections, and he frequently used it to create the defining statement for his famous lines.  The habit of naming collections was not new when Dior opened his house, but his titles were catchy and had huge popular appeal.  Particularly successful was his ploy of using letters from the alphabet to describe silhouettes of the mid-1950s: H line (autumn-winter 1954-1955), A line (spring-summer 1955) and Y line (autumn-winter 1955-1956).\nBelonging to the Y-line period, Dame Margot Fonteyn's strapless, 'princess' style evening gown is a sculptural masterpiece (an inverted Y) in crisp silk faille, shaped by a boned foundation attached to a multi-layered tulle petticoat.  The prima ballerina's slenderness, poise and streamlined elegance were perfect for the gown's strong lines.  A favourite with haute couture was the trick of composing two dresses in one - the front skirt was short (here, lower calf level) but dipped to an imposing floor sweeping train at the back.  It offered the grandeur of a full-length evening dress but the mobility of a short style.  In order to contain the dress within crisp borders, stiffening bands run within the neck and hem turnings.  Remaining true to his belief that 'a simple black dress\u2026 triumphs by is very austerity' (Dior by Dior, 1957), Dior kept the gown's smooth lines uncluttered sae for the restrained durative note of streamers that tied a the back an d trailed over the softly pleated centre panel.\nDior Archives, Paris\nOriginal chart with sketch and fabric sample:\nModel - Ren\u00e9e, Atelier - H\u00e9l\u00e8ne",
