            "history_note": "The Koran was owned by Bahadur Shah, the last Mughal emperor, until it was abandoned in the Palace at Delhi during the 1857 uprising. It was discovered by Sir Theophilus Metcalf, Magistrate of Delhi, who presented it to Miss Cannon. She gave it to the Museum in 1912. A letter on the Nominal File states: Antique Koran. Found under the pillows of the old King of Delhi on his capture by us at th efall of Delhi, during the Indian Mutiny of 1857 by Sir Theophilus Metcalfe [sic] Chief Magistrate at Delhi, who was foremost in the work of retribution. This Koran was given by Sir Theophilus Metcalfe to my mother (Mrs Henry Mills Cannon) soon after the fall of Delhi. The date of the book is uncertain [\"probably about 1660\" inserted] - It is a peculiar fine specimen . The gold being of a peculiarly exquisite quality. It contains the XIX (?) Book of the Koran - and includes the stories of Joseph, of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba etc. The King of Delhi probably kept it about him as an [sic] \"charm\".\n\nCaspar Stanley Clarke added to the file \"It might possibly date from the 17th century as stated, but the illuminated title-page suggests a later period. As an addition to the H.E.I.C. collection, historically speaking, it is of interest.\" (16.II.12) \nMiss Cannon offered the museum an ivory casket, also taken by Metcalf and supposed to have contained the Koran. It was rejected for purchase, but later bought by the Museum (IS 35-1937).",
