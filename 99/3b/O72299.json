He is affiliated with the movement known as Conceptualism which developed in the 1960s. Conceptualism questions the definition of art and often does so by undermining established social and aesthetic conventions. In La Soupe de Daguerre, as in many of his works, Broodthaers wittily questions accepted systems. The layout of this work, with its neatly arranged rows of images, suggests classification and order. But the images, and their physical reality as photographs, are the ingredients of a recipe for dispensing with any known systems and organisation, both literally and metaphorically: the re-constititution of image-making began when the Frenchman Louis Daguerre announced the first commercially available form of photography in 1839, throwing all hitherto known systems of representation into a kind of metaphorical soup. It is interesting to note that dictionary definitions of 'soup' includes 'photographic developer' and 'to be in the soup' as 'to be in trouble or difficulties'.",
