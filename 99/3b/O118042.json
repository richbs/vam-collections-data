Although the design is old, this ring is more likely to date from the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century, when rings like this, with facetted garnets mixed with hatched beads and with plants on the shoulders, were worn by the conservative rural population of southern Germany as part of their traditional costume.  Garnets and turquoises are very common in the region - in local tradition, red stands for love, and green for hope - but the two blue stones may have been replaced.  The two clasped hands at the back of the shank, which may have been added later, suggest that it was probably used as a betrothal ring.",
