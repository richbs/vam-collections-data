From 1874 to 1880, Voysey worked as a pupil in the office of J. P. Seddon, then briefly as an assistant to George Devey. In 1882 he set up his own office, but concentrated at first on decorative work rather than architecture, selling his first designs for fabrics and wallpaper in 1883. In 1884, he joined the Art Workers\u2019 Guild and his first house was not built until 1888.\n\nIn 1924, he was made Master of the Art Workers' Guild. His work was known in Europe through his participation in a number of exhibitions; he showed architectural work in the Salons de la Libre Esthetique in 1894 and 1897 and he also exhibited alongside the Glasgow School \u2018Four\u2019 at Liege in 1895 and in Turin in 1902.",
