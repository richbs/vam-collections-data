This crown-like mitre is a symbol of Christ the King, hence of the priesthood, and is worn at specific moments during a religious service. Before putting on the mitre, the priest says the following prayer, \u2018Put O Lord, upon my head the helmet of salvation to fight against the powers of the enemy, by the grace of Our Lord Jesus Christ\u2019.\n\nThe scenes depicted on this mitre are the Annunciation, the Baptism of Christ, the Last Supper, the Entombment and the Resurrection.",

The earliest eastern churches were established in Antioch, Alexandria and other cities in the 1st century. They were independent communities and theological controversy sharpened their differences.  \n\nIn 330 Constantinople (now Istanbul) became the capital of the Roman empire. Successive bishops of Constantinople, later given the title of patriarch, gradually won authority over other eastern churches, despite the opposition of the pope. Churches that accepted the jurisdiction of the patriarch became known as Orthodox, but others, including those of Armenia and Ethiopia, developed along separate lines. Diversity of practice and doctrine in the eastern churches is reflected in the different kinds of regalia and sacred silver. Yet some forms such as the chalice are common to all, indicating a shared core of beliefs.",
