A strip of plain weave cotton has been sewn around all four sides.\nDirectional design with the top of the pattern at the bottom of the panel, so that the wearer saw the correct pattern. The Museum Number is in the top right hand corner. The details of the pattern are indistinct. There is a border along the bottom: one pink blossom with 2 pink buds facing to the lower right alternating with a spray of 3 pale flowers pointing to the upper right.  There is a narrow border on 4 sides which extends part way up the sides of the panel: edged with a solid green line, circular motif outlined in dark blue - it resembles an outward pointing carnation - in light pink and yellow.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in light green and dark blue.\n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: green ground with large downward pointing pink flower on an angled striped stem, a cone-shape above a three-petalled flower and a straight downward pointing stem with 3 pale flowers.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] green ground with indistinct design including a vase outlined in light blue with a pink blossom, a faint blue one and then a pink one in a straight line alternating with a straight pale stem and a small central pink flower surrounded by small pale flowers with 3 blue flowers around the outer edges.\n[b] green ground with indistinct design including a circular pink flower segmented by dark lines with a blue flower to the upper left alternating with a pointed pink flower segmented with paler lines with a pink flower to the lower right and a blue flower below it.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; dark green, green, light green, yellow, pink, dark blue, light blue, black, orange, plus others difficult to identify.",
