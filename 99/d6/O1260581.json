Simplicity of design was essential, some in outline, others overlaid with panes of pattern, or mottled effects. Lucienne Day's relationship with G\u00f6ppinger was short lived, but she continued to work with Rosenthal for twelve years.\nLuicienne Day's earlier patterns for Rosenthal were all overtly experimental. However, from a technical point of view, some of her designs proved difficult to execute, therefore her later production designs became simpler in concept, with central motifs abandoned in favour of patterned bands or borders.\n\nThe Four Seasons design was Day's most  ambitious and complex design, showcased  at her solo exhibition at Heal's in 1958, but  not manufactured until 1959. Four  Season's consisted of four colour-coded  patterns of stylised linear designs. They  were originally conceived in white on a  coloured background, but due to concerns  about the acid-resistance of the enamels,  the designs were printed in reverse.",
