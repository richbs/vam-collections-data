His work spans conceptualism, minimalism and pop, without being easily categorised. He has a long-standing interest in drawing and has curated exhibitions including Drawing the Line (Whitechapel Art Gallery, 1995).  \n\nEarly in his career Craig-Martin's intention was, as far as possible, to remove self-expression from his drawings, and to achieve this he replaced pen and pencil with thin, flexible adhesive tape.\n\nProposal (bulb and watch) is part of Craig-Martin's extended enquiry into the nature of line which began in the 1960s. It was made in 1992, the cusp of the YBA (Young British Artist) period which was led by his former students. The drawing simplifies and refines a pair of ordinary objects to their schematic outlines, exploring conventions of representation.",
