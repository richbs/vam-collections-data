The play was adapted from Kenneth Grahame's 1908 book The Wind in the Willows.  The original cast included Michael Hordern as Toad, Bertram Shuttlewirth as Mole, William Squire as Water Rat, and Gwynn Michael as Badger.  The production was produced by John Kidd; the music was composed by H. Fraser-Simson; the scenery was designed by Reg. W. Sayle; the costumes were designed by Desmond Heeley; and the dances were arranged by Pauline Grant.\n\nThe production was revived at Stratford in December 1949 and December 1951, and at the Prince's Theatre, London, from 23 December 1954 until January 1955 when Edward Atienza played Mole, Brewster Mason played Badger and William Squire again played Ratty. Meg Simmons was in the London revival, billed as First Fieldmouse and Lucy Rabbit to the Harold Rabbit of the young Ian Holm.",
