The marquetry gives the clue to its origin, because English work differs from French in the proportions of the trellis design and the placement of the small circles of ebony - the English lozenge is less elongated.\n\nPeople\nDonald Ross, the maker of this table, worked in Denmark Street in Soho, London.  He was known as 'Thomas Henry Gallic Ross', and made reproduction furniture rather than forgeries. In 1911, when the Museum acquired it,  the table was thought to be a genuine Louis XVI piece.  Thomas Ross, the maker's son, wrote to the Museum in 1928 stating that several 'French, 18th-century' pieces in its collection had in fact been made by his father.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe carcase and drawer of this table are made of mahogany, over which is laid a veneer of marquetry. The trellis is made up of strips of purplewood,  boxwood and ebony, and the small circles are of ebony, while the ground is of satinwood.",
