After a short period working as a designer he turned to painting.  His work \u2013 in painting and in print \u2013 focussed on an interest in forms, shapes and the interaction of colour. He was greatly inspired by Piero della Francesca and Josef Albers. During the 1960s and 70s he exhibited regularly in Britain and abroad. In 1965 he was one of the first artists to produce limited-edition screen prints (screenprinting had previously been considered a commercial print medium and was not properly established as a fine art medium at that time, though it was soon taken up by artists in the 1960s). His screenprints were produced in collaboration with his wife Isolde who taught herself the process in order to work with him on his print editions; they produced 2 or 3 editions a year from the mid-60s to 1976. This is one of 6 prints donated by Isolde Hedegaard to the V&A in 2012 (see E.484-489-2012).",
