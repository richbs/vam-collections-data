NB: extra warps added along the top of the lower outer (blue) border with the ends visible on the front.\n\nWeft:  red wool; Z2S; 2 shoots after each row of knots; 14 knots to the inch (54 per dm).\n\nPile:  wool; 8 colours: red, yellow, dark green, green, dark blue, blue, black, white; asymmetrical knot open to the left and tied around 2 threads; 182 knots to the sq. inch (2808 per sq. dm).\n\nSide finish:  both sides have a single corn oversewn in a plait of red and green wool.\n\nEnd finish:  both ends are incomplete.\n\nDesign:  field:  red ground with hundreds of small yellow botehs (upside down as viewed from either end) with dark blue and white centres; they are in off-set rows.  In each of the four corners a white square encloses half of the above inscription (in riqa script?) and is in dark blue.  Along the top and bottom edge a rainbow zigzag in green, dark blue, blue, yellow and red outlines a dark blue band with a small white boteh (headless in the lower band) within each fold.  Along the sides the lines are elongated to form multiple angular arches also enclosing a white boteh on dark blue.\n\nOn both sides, half way up, an arch is replaced by an enlarged niche enclosing two leafy sprigs.  Beneath the right-hand niche a small, stylised sprig and a multi-coloured flower lie in the field.\n\nMain border:  yellow ground with red or white angular meander (less angular along bottom and top) linking blue or light blue flowers and framing a white rosette and a pair of red botehs.\n\nInner and outer border:  a blue ground in both lower borders and for one third of the way up the sides (and including main border blossoms) and thence light blue until the top borders where they revert to blue; black meander with red flowers and white leaves.",
