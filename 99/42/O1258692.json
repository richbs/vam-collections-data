This plate is even more unusual having been made specifically for the customer of a bespoke dinner service, to show the possible choices of border decorations for the commission. The combination of the lack of pattern numbers for the different border designs, rendering it useless as a showroom or  retailer's piece, and the meticulously painted crest indicate the use of this trial plate for a one off commission.  The customer may have specifically requested the green and gilt colour-scheme and this trial dish would have allowed them to see which border design would best suit  their crest. \nSpode armorial painting  was some of the finest quality produced and the  highly gilded borders, which relate to designs in the Spode pattern books between 1810 and 1830, were expensive production.",
