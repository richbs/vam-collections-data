Louis Lebeuf and Etienne Thibault operated the business from 1825 to 1833, and the wares were stamped 'Creil and Montereau' and 'Lebeuf Milliet & Cie.' from about 1840 until the death of Lebeuf in 1876. \n\nEarthenware made at the Creil factory was the first French pottery to use transfer printing on earthenware. By reproducing engravings on different topics they created several sets of plates, including 'Le Nouveau Paris', views of the city, and another of views of  Switzerland. Equestrian acts were very popular in French circus during the 19th century, at a time when there were several permanent circus buildings in Paris.",
