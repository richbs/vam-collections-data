The front legs are joined to those at the back by slab ends which fill the whole sides and almost reach the ground. Above these slabs are the broad arms: straight on the inside with a deep chamfered curve for comfort towards the back and S-curved on the outside. Their front ends have curved edges decorated with notches. The back legs are deep square members which rise to form the side supports of the back. This is formed as two curved low seat backs joined by a short straight section, the whole filled with a grid of sixty squares, four high and seven wide on each curved seat back and four stacked vertically in the central straight section. The broad member across the back which forms the base of this grid is straight at the front and shaped to follow the curves of the seat backs at the back. The seat backs have each a central cresting in the shape of a triple-stepped ziggurat.",
