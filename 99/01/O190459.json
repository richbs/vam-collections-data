            "public_access_description": "The Omega Workshops at 33 Fitzroy Square were founded in 1913 by the designer and painter Roger Fry (1866-1934).  He brought together a group of artists to design furniture, pottery, glass, textiles and entire schemes of interior decoration.  Their radically abstract  style, typified by this textile, was far ahead of its time and was influenced by developments in contemporary painting.\n\nIn keeping with the painting tradition, Fry believed that designs should not be too mechanical and should show evidence of the artist's hand.  The workshops produced six printed linens which were used by the most daring clients as dress fabrics.  The printers are said to have used a secret process to 'preserve the freedom and spontaneity of the original drawing'.  'White' was possibly named after the suffragette Amber Blanco-White, who rented a room at the top of the building in Fitzroy Square. It was available in several colourways.",
