Right side fastening with four gilt buttons, long and tight sleeves with horse hoof cuffs (matixiu). No lining. Orange gauze ground embroidered with coloured floss silks in counted stitch. The main body of the robe was originally in orange but is now very much faded up.\nThe embroidered design consists of nine five-clawed dragons (three on the front, plus one beneath the flap, three on the back and one on each shoulder) chasing flaming jewels among tightly curled cloud bands and bats. The lower part of the robe contains long lishui and waves.The sleeves, below the level of the orange with its proper edging of li-shui and waves, have an extra band of black satin, with dragons in profile chasing a pearl above mountains, wave and shallow li-shui, then a horse-shoe cuff with dragon full-face above waves surrounded by cloud-bands and bats.\nThe colour (orange is considered in China as a shade of yellow), the 9th dragon on the inner flap, the quality of the weaving and embroidery of this Manchu girl's robe could indicated that it have been worn by a member of the imperial family, perhaps the daughter of an imperial consort, or a young princess. However; through the lack of provenance there is no certainty.",
