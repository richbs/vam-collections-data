The lower cornice is carved with acanthus leaves, petals and husks above a running pattern of roses.  The upper cornice has a cavetto, or concave, frieze carved with acanthus foliage above a guilloche moulding. Each of the upper cupboard units contains three adjustable shelves. The glass panes in the doors are original.  The bun feet are later replacements.\n\nPeople\nThe bookcase was one of a pair made for William Blathwayt, who was Secretary of War to William III from 1683 to 1704.  His uncle, Thomas Povey, was a  friend of the diarist Samuel Pepys and Blathwayt may have seen Pepys's  library in Buckingham Street, London. It had twelve similar oak bookcases, which were made from 1666 onwards as required. These are now at Magdalene College, Cambridge. \n\nPlace\nBlathwayt acquired the Dyrham estate through his marriage in 1686 to the heiress Mary Wynter. In the 1690s he rebuilt west and east fronts, to designs by the architects  Samuel Hauduroy and William Talman. The fine woodwork was  supplied by London joiners. Thomas Hunter, of the Angel, Piccadilly, who made the sash windows, may  have supplied these bookcases.\n\n",
