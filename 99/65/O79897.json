The chair has a plain frame back with three turned and waisted spindles set into the cresting rail at the top and the upper of two rectilinear bars beneath.  The upright poles of the back have turned, slightly domed tops, and descend into the back legs which are square in section but with planed corners at the base.  The arms are curved and splayed; they are set into the uprights of the back and pegged into the uprights of the front.  The baluster-shaped front uprights have round turned bases and descend into the squared tops of the front leg poles (which are also turned).  The chair has a turned stretcher at the front and single stretcher rods at the sides and back; the legs are set into two angled square-sectioned rockers which have short fronts and longer backs.  The seat is trapezoid in shape with a hand-woven rush surface.",
