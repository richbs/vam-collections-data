The earliest playbills were handwritten, but by 1700 bills were usually printed. Playbills of the 18th and early 19th centuries were produced for each day and usually give the date, the cast and any necessary information about tickets. They might also mention forthcoming performances. Often a play's author would not be credited. \n\nThe newly 'Ornamented and Decorated' Theatre Royal advertised in this playbill was in Edinburgh. Mrs H. Siddons, who appeared in The Wedding-Day as Lady Conquest, was Harriet, wife of the actor, Henry. She and her husband Henry managed the theatre between 1809 and 1815 and, as the playbill shows, they were able to attract actors from some of the country's major theatres.\n\nMr Berry who played Dr Ollapod in The Poor Gentleman had caused problems earlier in the week. On 15 November the theatre's management issued a cancellation notice which informed the public that the theatre would not be opening that evening because of the non-appearance of Mr Berry who had let them down three times. The Theatre and Performance Department has a copy of this notice (S.54-2008).",
