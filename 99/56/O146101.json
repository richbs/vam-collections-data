Long hipped outline largely left open.  Two front loops, one in black cord holding a metal button but it is unclear whether the plain blue cord loop is original, and the exact position of the closure point is unclear.\nMain Fabric: madder pink satin patterned with an open offset repeating pattern in twill of 2 stylised leaves and fan-shaped petals in yellow outlined in dark brown, with a green and yellow base; some small yellow details separate the motifs top and bottom.\nWarp: madder pink silk; Z-twist\nWeft: pink, brown and green silk with silver strip open S-wound on a yellow silk core.\nThere is evidence of a loom end front and back at the shoulder seam of 4 lines of metal thread. The pattern motif is very like others found in fragments in the Collection.\nFacing: bias cut plain weave black silk along hem.  Note how the facings have been sewn together along the sleeves.\nLining: pieced from three fabrics:\n[1] front and back: coarse white plain weave cotton resist and block printed with large floral sprays in ovoid shapes in olive green, brown and pink; arranged in offset rows.\n[2] inside front flaps: coarse pinkish-white plain weave cotton resist and block printed with intertwining delicate black stems bearing light green leaves and rust red blossoms.\n[3] As cuff facing: rust red plain weave cotton, resist and block printed with a small, repeating pattern of 3 floral stems in offset rows in light blue, yellow and green and white.\n[4] Inside left sleeve coarse plain weave cotton with olive green field carrying white flower heads with yellow stem in offset rows- block resist printed.",
