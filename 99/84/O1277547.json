Charles Wyndham (1837-1919). The sketches were created for publication in The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News, July 29th 1899. They have been signed by the artist, Samuel Begg (1854-1936) in the bottom right hand corner.\n\nThe illustrations were produced to mark Sir. Charles Wyndham's departure from the Criterion Theatre after twenty three consecutive years managing the venue. The departure was marked with a performance of the comedy Rosemaryby Louis N. Parker and actor Murray Carson, in which the actress Miss Mary Moore took the leading role and Sir Charles Wyndham played the part of Sir Jasper Thorndyke.\n\nCharles Wyndham (1837-1919) was associated with the theatre for over 20 years.  As a young man Wyndham combined acting with medicine. He travelled to America in 1862 to enlist in the Federal army as a medical officer but also appeared onstage. On his return to England in 1865, he dedicated himself solely to the theatre becoming the dashing young hero of Victorian farce. He made his name at London's Royalty Theatre in a burlesque comedy in 1866, and appeared at the Criterion in December 1875 in the comedy Brighton. By Easter 1876 he was a profit-sharing partner in the Criterion, leased by Alexander Henderson. Wyndham was in his element in risqu\u00e9 farces, often adapted from French originals. The profits he made from managing the Criterion theatre enabled him to build Wyndham's Theatre in 1899 and the New Theatre (later the Albery) in 1903. His record of continuous and simultaneous West End management is without equal and his experience of touring internationally also exceptional. He received his knighthood in 1902.",
