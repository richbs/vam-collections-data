St Lawrence, a Christian martyr, was roasted on a gridiron for refusing to give the Roman authorities the Church's money. This study is for the figure of a man carrying faggots for the fire. In the finished painting he is on the lower right-hand side.\n\n\u2018Tintoretto\u2019  was the nickname of Jacopo Robusti, whose father was a \u2018tintore\u2019 (cloth-dyer).  Unusually for his time, Tintoretto worked out a lot of his ideas directly onto the canvas.  This means that preparatory drawings such as this study are relatively rare - about 130 survive. They are quite roughly and quickly drawn, with almost no drawings of whole compositions. Most show only a single figure or a small group.  The V&A holds 11 of these important drawings (Dyce 235-236, Dyce 239-247). All except one once belonged to the distinguished English portrait painter Sir Joshua Reynolds.",
