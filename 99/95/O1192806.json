This poster depicts the female members of Imam Husayn's family mourning his death at the Battle of Karbala in 680AD. \n\nThe majority of Iran\u2019s population are Shi'ia Muslims. The Shi\u2019ite sect began in the 650s, when Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad and Husayn\u2019s father became Caliph (leader of the Muslim people). Many supported another candidate, the Umayyad Mu'awiya, who subsequently become Caliph when Ali was murdered in 661 AD. The supporters of Ali, became known as the Shiites, which means \"the followers of Ali\u201d. Twenty years after Ali died another rival Umayyad Caliph weakened Shi\u2019ite rule by killing Husayn, along with most of his male family and followers at Karbala in Iraq. Still today, Shi\u2019ites mourn the death of Imam Husayn by performing rituals and remembering the Battle of Karbala in popular imagery such as this poster.",
