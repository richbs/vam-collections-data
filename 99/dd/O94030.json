The members of the X-frame are of rectangular section, the feet carved as formalised lion paws with acanthus frond above, all gilded, and the top with lion heads with acanthus below, not gilded. At the crossings, the frame is set with a gilt-bronze patera and the frame is set and strengthened on the outer edges of the crossing with giltwood inserts, carved in a fan motif.  The cross stretcher is turned in a double baluster.  The seat is upholstered on a structural frame of beech, the visible edges veneered with mahogany.  The upholstery has been renewed in the mid-twentieth century and is now covered in beige silk satin with an edge-braiding woven with formalised foliage in browns and beiges.",

            "public_access_description": "Jacob-Desmalter was the largest and most fashionable supplier of furniture in Paris from about 1800 to 1820. The firm certainly made this stool, and its pair, although neither bears their stamped mark. A hand-written paper label inside one of the long seat rails is inscribed with the name of the client, Marshal Ney, and the name of the room for which it was provided, the Petit Salon. Jacob-Desmalter is the only maker known to have used this form of labelling. The seat rails of the stool have been replaced at some time and it is likely that the firm's stamped mark was lost at that time.\n\nMarshal Ney (1769\u20131815) was a celebrated military hero in the Napoleonic army. After Napoleon was crowned as emperor in 1804, he was keen to establish his marshals as part of his imperial court. He arranged suitable marriages for several of them. Ney's wife, whose mother had been one of Queen Marie Antoinette's ladies-in-waiting before the French Revolution of 1789, was particularly successful in helping her husband to consolidate his position. In March 1805 they acquired a grand Paris house, the H\u00f4tel de Saisseval, and immediately began to decorate and furnish it, using the firm of Jacob-Desmalter. The Petit Salon was one of the more simply decorated rooms in the house, with seat furniture in mahogany. This was in contrast to the giltwood used in the Salon Vert and other, grander rooms.",
