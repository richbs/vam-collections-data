Such portraits were known to have arrived at the Mughal court in the early 17th century, as recorded by the first English ambassador to India, Sir Thomas Roe. He showed the emperor Jahangir a miniature painting by the artist, which was then famously copied by Jahangir's leading artist in five almost indistinguishable versions over several weeks in 1616. With the decline of Mughal power in the late 17th century, the royal collections began to be dispersed and by the 18th century many former imperial treasures must have entered other collections in the subcontinent.",

The work of Isaac Oliver is known to have reached the Mughal court as early as 1616, as recorded by the first English ambassador to India, Sir Thomas Roe. He showed the emperor Jahangir a miniature painting by the artist, which was then  famously copied by Jahangir's leading artist in five almost indistinguishable versions over several weeks in 1616. Roe had agreed to a wager, which he lost, that he could be able to distinguish the original from the copies. Sucj imported miniatures had an important influence on the development of Jahangiri portraiture. The figure of Jahangir by Bichitr in the Freer Gallery is thought to be possibly derived from a miniature by Isaac Oliver.",
