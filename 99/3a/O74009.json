This is a particularly elaborate example - most jamas were made of plain white cotton - and is patterned with a repeating block-printed floral design. The ties at the side have been made into a decorative feature in themselves, with carefully designed floral motifs made to fit the lappets. \nJamas were popular court wear at the Mughal, Rajput and Deccani courts. They were worn somewhat shorter in the 17th century - by the 18th century when this jama was made and worn, the fashion was for ankle-length robes.",
