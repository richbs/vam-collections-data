His work is not only about, but literally made with, contemporary culture. His trademark sculptures, known as 'combines', are just that - objects from everyday life fixed together, often with an application of paint - in unlikely, but thought-provoking combinations. This principle was subsequently brought into play when he began making prints. He was one of the first artists to transfer photographic images onto canvas and paper, which gives images such as Pull a sense of contact with the world of newspapers, advertising and mass media. He extended this contact with reality by incorporating actual objects, such as the paper bag we see floating from the diver's right arm, and using layers of cloth (muslin and taffeta) to give the image both movement and a visual indistinctness that is implicit in the central image of the Olympic diver.",

London : V&A Publications, 2001. p 9 : ill.\nTimmers, Margaret (ed), <i>Impressions of the Twentieth Century: Fine Art Prints from the V&A's Collection</i>, London, V&A Publications, 2001\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>Robert Rauschenberg (born 1925)</b> \n\n<i>Pull</i>, 1974 \n\nRauschenberg defies categorization and his artistic output pushes outwards the limits of convention.  As well as being a painter, sculptor, photographer, set designer and performance artist, he has conducted some remarkable experiments as a printmaker.  Though considered by some as a Pop artist, his early abstract paintings of the 1950s in fact made him part of the movement called Abstract Expressionism, and some of the later works after 1970 are defined in the contemporary sense of installations.  This print is a good example of how he subverted accepted ideas about the materials to be used and even the concept of printmaking itself. \nIf the most basic definition of a print is 'an exactly repeatable image', then his version of a famous photograph of an Olympic diver, screenprinted mistily on and through layers of fabric, collaged with paper bags sewn in between the muslin and taffeta, defies even this definition.  The border areas of the print recall his earlier experiments in the 1950s with the technique he developed of 'solvent transfer'.  Advertising images printed in magazines were transferred to another surface by soaking them in a liquid that partially softened and released the layers of printing ink from the original paper. \nThe ambiguity of the central image, a man diving gracefully like a bird, before plunging into the beautiful blue and uncertain depths of a pool, is reflected in the slightly out-of-register printing through the veils of fabric.  This gives the effect of something clear-cut but glimpsed only at speed, a visual paradox, one of many that run throughout the artist's work.  The image of the diving man had been used many times since, but it was Rauschenberg, as so often, who pioneered the way.\"",
