They were originally made of twisted metal, as the name implies, and were used as indications of rank in Celtic times.  They survived as part of the traditional jewellery in a number of places, including Syria. \n\nThe design of this torque, with different wires twisted together and linked by a hook at the front, and long chain pendants ending in coins, is typical of those made in Syria and Iraq.  They were mainly worn by the nomadic Bedouin.  This example was bought for the Museum for five shillings and six pence at the International Exhibition, London, 1872 as part of a large quantity of traditional Syrian jewellery.  It was described as worn by children.",
