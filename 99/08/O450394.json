This portion is composed of two fragmentary arcs of a stepped torana springing from <i>makaras</i> placed on the sides of aedicules with cylindrical pillars ornamented with annular bands. The lower aedicule contains a female figure in <i>tribanga</i> posture gazing into a disc held aloft in her left hand while she holds the handle of an undenitified oject in her right hand. (Might this be a representation of the <i>yakshini</i>, Cakresvari,whose most popular attribute is a disc (<i>cakra</i>)?) The two arcs are carved with three sword-carrying <i>vidhyadharas</i>, who also carry round objects knotted into cloth coverings in their left hands: (are these a type of cosh?). A rounded moulding ornamented with diagonally strung beading curves over them with an outer smooth <i>cavetto</i> moulding punctuated by deeply carved linear dashes.  A smaller simlarly carved moulding is on the underside. Part of a damaged figure rests on the outer edge of the lower arc. Both <i>makaras</i> have rounded objects covered in knotted cloths similar to those being carried by the vidhyadaras, tucked in above their curling snouts.",

(1815-1884), former Governor of Bombay, in 1877.\n  As John Guy writes in The Peaceful Liberators (see reference below) the high degree of stylistic uniformity suggests that these pieces were collected from a single temple, or at least from sites that were contemporary.  They are related to known Solanki dynasty temples of the 11th and 12th centuries: inscriptions record that endowments were made to the Shatrunjaya temples during the reign of Siddharaja Jayasimha (1095-1142), a Solanki ruler renowned for his patronage.",
