            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 90, 92, 93\nThe following is an extract from the text on the entry:\n\nThis is the drawing made for the engraving by John Landseer which appears facing p. 92 in the poem <i>The Social Day</i> by Peter Coxe, published in 1823. The drawing was commissioned for engraving in 1814, when it was at first intended that the book should appear. In the British Museum Library (<i>Catalogue of Printed Books</i>, Vol. 44, 1949, col. 452) is a prospectus for the book in which it is originally promised for 1814: this date is altered in manuscript to 1822. The proofs of the engravings illustrating the poem were published by James Carpenter in 1822, the year before he produced the complete book. \nIn his letter of 17 February 1814 to Maria Bicknell, Constable wrote: \"I have lately made (?) a little picture for Mr. Peter Cox, to help to illustrate his poem (the Social Day), which is forthcoming. I think it will be a pretty book and he has a very noble subscription for it, in which I see the names of the Bishop of Salisbury & Mr Watts\" (revised text communicated by Mr. Ian Fleming Williams). He wrote to John Dunthorne, senior on 22 February 1814: \"Tell Abram [Constable] that Mr Cox intends having my 'Windmill' engraved and has put it into .Mr Landseer's hands for that purpose, who is a very superior landscape engraver. This I am glad of, for it is a pretty subject-it is one of the Stoke mills I was at with you & Mr Frost when I did it many years ago\" (Beckett, I, p. 101). In his article \"Constable as an illustrator\" (<i>Connoisseu</i>r, Vol. CXXXIV, 1954, pp. 79-80), Beckett points out that the connection with George Frost of Ipswich helps to identify this Stoke as the place near that town, and not Stoke-by-Nayland. For a drawing of the same subject by George Frost see, 'The Drawings of George Frost 1745-1821' by John Hayes, <i>Master Drawings</i>, Vol. 4, No. 2, 1966, p. 167 and n. 31. The drawing by Constable in the British Museum No. 1936-3-14-1 is a monochrome version with variations of No. 123 [342-1888]. It is inscribed in ink <i>Drawn by J. Constable 1815 & given to his friend J. T. Smith Esq. 1823</i>. Beckett's suggestion (<i>loc. cit.</i>) that this is the original sketch from nature, based on his reading of the first date as 1805, is unlikely; the drawing appears rather to have been made at the time the engraving was in question.  In the inscription written in 1823 Constable was probably relying on memory for the date 1815 (see also No. 162 [320-1891] for an error made in the date in similar circumstances).  No. 342a-1888 in the Victoria and Albert Museum is a proof of the engraving by J. Landseer from No. 123 [342-1888].",
