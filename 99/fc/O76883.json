These are widely spaced and interspersed by six small roundels, enclosing bi-focating stalks.\n\nOn the underside, four concentric double fillets have been engraved, one with a sketchy foliate scroll. At the centre is a roundel with a bi-focating stalk - possibly re-engraved at a leter time.\nOn the outer wall are six epigraphic horizontal cartouches with incurving sides and roundels enclosing palmettes.\nThe inner surface has a roundel framed by a broad moulded groove, encloses four hares walking clockwise. Their long ears are depicted so that in each pair the ear of one is also to be seen as the ear of the next hare. Foliate scrolls form the ground. \n\nPatina: extensive patches of red oxide on the underside indicating the piece was excavated. Otherwise olive patina veering to spotty dark brown. Some traces of black composition possibly added later. Traces of lead soldering, showing legs to have been added and subsequently knocked off.",
