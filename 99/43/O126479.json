Her early jewellery, made in the early 1960s with her husband David Watkins, used screen-printed acrylic and paper. \n\nIn about 1970 she turned to working in silver and gold, rapidly establishing a distinctive minimalist style influenced by modernism and industrial design. Its linear purity and decisive blocks of colour, along with the in-built versatility of her work, gained her the Council of Industrial Design Award in 1972. \n\nWendy Ramshaw is a leading and internationally renowned artist jeweller, who experiments with a wide range of materials and new technologies. Artistically she was always ahead of her time, her designs are distinctive and innovative. \n\nIn this necklace Ramshaw has translated enamelling, a traditional craft, into a modern language with colourful and ornamental inlaid bands. It was part of the collection which won the Council of Industrial Design Award, 1972.",
