By the mid 1950s snigly fitted cap-styles of hat were extremely popular as they worked perfectly with fashionable hairstyles, short and often set with curls at the front and sides. The hat pin was used to fix the hat into the hair.\n\nThe milliner Svend was born in Denmark and opened his first shop in Copenhagen. Aage Thaarup, milliner to the Queen and a fellow Dane recalled meeting Svend in 1946 on a trip to Copenhagen straight after the war. Thaarup was one of London's most noted milliners at the time and recalled that Svend 'begged me to look at his hats during my visit...To me the talent was apparent even in that first year...'.\n\nSvend went on to move to Paris to create hats for the designer Jacques Fath and by 1956 he had established his own millinery label in Paris.",
