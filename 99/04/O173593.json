Nine of the group were acquired by the V&A (E.1170-1178-1988), while the tenth, of Mary Sidney, Countess of Pembroke, by Nicholas Hilliard, is now held by the National Portrait Gallery, London. The complex provenance of this group is described in an article by Sir Roy Strong, \"The Leicester House Miniatures\", Burlington Magazine, CXXVII, October 1988. However, this miniature and E.1175-1988 were only added to this group in the early 20th century and are not referred to by Strong. A miniature in oil on copper of the same sitter by Francois Clouet is also in the collection (623-1882)",
