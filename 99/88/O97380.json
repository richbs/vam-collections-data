A measured quantity of powder was drawn off by using the spring-loaded cap on the nozzle.\n\nFirearms became more and more sophisticated during the 16th-century. They required a number of accessories to load and operate them. The main charge, placed in the barrel with the shot, was carried in a powder flask. Smaller priming flasks like this contained fine-grain powder for priming the pans of wheel-lock firearms. This flask has two suspension rings for attaching to a bandolier, a type of sling worn over the shoulder or around the waist, from which hung the various accessories required for a weapon including spanners for the mechanism, measured charges, powder flasks and priming flasks.\n\nLike the pistols and guns that accompanied them, decorated flasks were costly items. Inlaid firearms and flasks reflected the owners' status and were kept as much for display as for use. Daggers, firearms, gunpowder flasks and stirrups worn with the most expensive clothing projected an image of the fashionable man-at-arms. The most finely crafted items were worn as jewellery.",

A measured quantity of powder was drawn off by using the spring-loaded cap on the nozzle.\n\nFirearms became more and more sophisticated during the 16th-century. They required a number of accessories to load and operate them. The main charge, placed in the barrel with the shot, was carried in a powder flask. Smaller priming flasks like this contained fine-grain powder for priming the pans of wheel-lock firearms. This flask has two suspension rings for attaching to a bandolier, a type of sling worn over the shoulder or around the waist, from which hung the various accessories required for a weapon including spanners for the mechanism, measured charges, powder flasks and priming flasks.\n\nLike the pistols and guns that accompanied them, decorated flasks were costly items. Inlaid firearms and flasks reflected the owners' status and were kept as much for display as for use. Daggers, firearms, gunpowder flasks and stirrups worn with the most expensive clothing projected an image of the fashionable man-at-arms. The most finely crafted items were worn as jewellery.",
