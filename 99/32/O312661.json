            "public_access_description": "This cream coloured terracotta relief was excavated from the site of Suffolk Place, Southwark, London, the palace of Charles Brandon, brother-in-law of Henry VIII.\nSuffolk Place was a vast house built by Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, between 1518 and 1522. It  is the earliest example of a Tudor courtyard house known to have carried this type of extensive terracotta decoration. This use of terracotta quickly became fashionable and appeared on other buildings commissioned by Henry VIII's courtiers, including Cardinal Wolsey's York Place (later Whitehall) and Hampton Court Palace.\n\nCharles Brandon was an orphan raised at the court of Henry VII and became a life-long friend of Henry VIII, who made him 1st Duke of Suffolk in 1514.  The Duke was one of Henry VIII's most powerful courtiers, marrying Henry's sister, Mary, in 1518.\n\nThe relief is made of moulded clay which was dried and fired to create terracotta (literally 'cooked earth'), a material suitable for use as external decoration. The scale of  building projects such as Suffolk Place was vast and by using a cheap raw material and a reproductive method of manufacture, the buildings could be decorated economically and speedily. In the 16th century there was a fashion for terracotta decoration on buildings. To meet the great demand, the terracotta was mass-produced in moulds. Each clay piece was allowed to dry a little, removed from the mould and fired in a kiln before being incorporated into the building.",
