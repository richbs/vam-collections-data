Below left is a stylised cluster of foliage enclosing a bird's nest containing four eggs. Below right stands a 'proud' turkey and beneath him two plump hens and a cock. \n\nThe tapestry is woven in multi-colours on a multi-coloured ground, and the colour change is effected by great deal of skilled hatching. The dominant hues are red and green outlined and detailed in dark blue. The scene is enclosed by a border of roundels patterned with simple and bold geometric motifs.\n\nThe tapestry is woven in woollen warp with 11 threads per inch and woollen weft with and average of 18 threads per inch.",

            "public_access_description": "Edward Bawden was a British painter who trained as an illustrator, book designer and mural painter at the Royal College of Art from 1922-1925.  He practised as an illustrator, poster designer and textile artist throughout the 1930s, evidentally returning to teach at the RCA.  Bawden produced work for the Westminster Bank, the London Transport Board and the publishers Curwen Press for whom he made book covers and illustrations.  In 1933 Bawden had his first solo exhibition at the Zwemmers Gallery in London.  During the Second World War he served as an official war artist in the British Army, travelling to France, Belgium and the Middle East.  His later work is celebrated for its simplicity and wit and he is remembered as one of Britain's most original and eccentric artists.  Farmyard demonstrates the strong sense of colour that is to be found in much of his post war work and features humorous and lively imagery typical of Bawden.  It was woven at the Dovecot Studios in Edinburgh by Ronald Cruickshank and apprentices Alex Jack, Fred Mann and Archie Brennan.",
