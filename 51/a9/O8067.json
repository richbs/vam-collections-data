            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nDuring the 18th century, ceramic plates gained in popularity over those made from pewter. Cheaper than porcelain, though offering similar decorative possibilities, delftware (English-made, tin-glazed earthenware) was a popular choice. This stylishly decorated delftware plate, dating from the mid-1750s, probably represents the high-point in the fashionability of the material. However, delftware was already facing competition from the white salt-glazed stonewares of Staffordshire, and both were soon to be eclipsed by creamware.\n\nDecoration\nThe single most important influence on the decoration of English delftware was porcelain from East Asia. From the early 17th century to the very end of the 18th century, a succession of Chinese and Japanese painting styles and motifs were adopted by potters in England. Imports of Chinese porcelain during the 17th century provided prototypes that were copied more or less faithfully, but from around 1680, an English Chinoiserie style began to emerge, with pottery painters inventing their own simplifications, abstractions and patterns. Both the central motif of this plate and its powdered pigment border show an East Asian influence.",
