It has a predominately dark wood finish with three parts painted lightly in green so the wood texture still shows through. The base of the shooting range, the arm and the top are all in this colour. It sits on four circular parts to hold it off the floor slightly. There is a hole at the top of the box and a lever at the front. The design of the front allows the sides to come down in a curved and decorative way. The words 'The \"Daisy\" Pneumatic Shooting Range' appear on the front in a gold colour and an outline of a daisy with the words 'The Daisy' on top.",

Originally known as the Plymouth Iron Windmill Company, it began to make air rifles that were given away free with every windmill. These rifles then became more popular than the windmills and the company changed its name in 1895 to Daisy Manufacturing Company, Inc . The small Daisy BB gun became a staple in American youth culture, despite competition from other guns such as Dandy and Bullseye. The company is now based in Arkansas in the South and continues to manufacture air guns.\n\nThis object is The \"Daisy\" Pneumatic Shooting Range and is an Iles Patent. Daisy Outdoor Products has a strong educational programme, working with a number of national youth organisations, in order for young owners to learn the responsibility of gun ownership. The company produces other merchandise other than its guns for fans, such as coasters, t-shirts and key rings.",
