Each medallion is contained within a scroll, flower and shellwork cartouche. The upper border of each door is of irregular scroll profile, rising towards the centre. The central column is attached to the right door and is of nearly semicircular section, with pierced scrolls and flowers applied to the upper and lower ends and the centre; a spiral pattern of flowers is embossed along its length. The centre is engraved with an oval medallion of Christ as the Great Bishop. Rosettes are applied at intervals to the plain side borders of the gates. The lower border of each door is flat-chased with a lengthy Cyrillic inscription in Old Church Slavonic.",

They are traditionally said to have been given to the monks by Catherine the Great of Russia. Such gates, normally of painted and gilded wood, stand at the centre of the iconostasis (wall of icons) in an Orthodox church. They separate the nave from the sanctuary and form the focal point of the church. The relief panels represent (clockwise from top left) the annunciation of Christ's birth, his triumphal entry into Jerusalem and the four evangelists (John, Luke, Mark and Matthew).\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
