Following the plain appearance of Neo-classical dress, a new decorative trend can be seen in the patterning of the gown and the embellishment of the shoulders. In order to provide warmth for lightweight gowns, jackets such as this one in blue velvet were worn. It follows the high-waisted style of the dress, but has long sleeves and a high collar. Such jackets were known as \u2018spencers\u2019. They were named after George, 2nd Earl Spencer (1758-1834), who is said to have worn short jackets without tails in the 1790s and started the fashion for them. Similar spencers for walking dress can be seen in fashion magazines of the period 1815-1825.",
