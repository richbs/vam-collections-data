Most had a loop on the back for attachment, but in Norway and Sweden stud buttons were also used.  These were mainly worn by men, at the throat, to keep their shirts closed.  They were usually decorated with filigree.  \n\nThis stud is typical of those worn at the beginning of the 19th century.  It has the maker's mark 'EH', and was probably made by Erik Holmberg, who was a silversmith in Lund at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century.  Lund is in Sk\u00e5ne, in the extreme south of Sweden.   Sk\u00e5ne province has the richest tradition of jewellery, and more was worn there than in any other district.  Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.",
