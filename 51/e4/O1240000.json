She moved to London in 1948, and ten years later opened her own print studio as the Print Workshop in Charlotte Street, London, the first open access print workshop for artists. She was a pioneer in her practice too, championing the status of print as fine art, and experimenting with techniques (often in innovative combinations or applications).  She established a formidable reputation as a printmaker - notably in lithography and etching - and in the later 1960s and 1970s won particular recognition for her blind-embossed (inkless) prints.  Thanks to the generosity of the Birgit Ski\u00f6ld Memorial Trust, the artist's archive came to the AAD in 1997. The archive includes impressions of almost all her prints, but this print is one of a further gift of 13 prints given to the print collection at South Kensington.",
