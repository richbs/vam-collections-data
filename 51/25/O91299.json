It is beautifully made and carefully seen: the tear in the tablecloth echoes the open mouth of the nearest salmon.  The photograph combines the popular genre motif of fisherfolk with a tradition of still life. It also shows the liking of the time for dressing up.  Beneath the shawls and skirts is Crawshay\u2019s daughter, Rose Harriette. On 23 March 1868 she wrote in her diary:  \u2018Papa came in with the ugliest, dirtiest, nastiest old straw bonnet that ever existed and a cap (thank goodness that was clean) for me to be photographed in as a fish woman which lasted till lunch time\u2019.",
