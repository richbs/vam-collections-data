Each screenprint was produced from a pen plotter drawing made by the artist between 1970 and 1975.  A pen plotter is a mechanical device that holds a pen or brush and is linked to a computer that controls its movements.  Pen plotter drawings can be very time consuming to produce.  By transferring the unique plotter drawing into a screenprint, the artist was able to produce multiple copies of the image.\n\nEach image in this set of eight prints was created using a computer program written by Manfred Mohr.  The set illustrates the artist's ongoing exploration of the cube, which began in the early 1970s.  Here Mohr has broken the cube down into its twelve constituent lines, which he describes as being like 'an alphabet' that he can combine in different ways to create each individual image.  The computer program was based on a series of decision making processes that positioned these lines.  The artist deliberately wrote random variables into the program to allow the computer to make certain choices from a given number of options.  The artist would not have been able to fully predict the appearance of each image until the plotter had finished drawing.",
