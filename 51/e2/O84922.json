            "public_access_description": "This candlestick comes from an area in south-east Turkey with a strong tradition of casting in bronze. When inlaid decoration was introduced from Iran, local metalworkers applied it to objects that had been cast rather than formed from sheet brass. Here the inlay has been used to create medallions with scenes of hunting and revelry interspersed with key-patterns, figures of animals and birds and plant ornament.\n\t \nFor larger motifs metalworkers chiselled out small areas of the surface and filled them with thin sheets of silver, gold and copper. They added details by chasing the surface of the softer metals. They created contrast with a black filler. The results were, for metalwork, an unusually graphic form of decoration, often of great quality.",
