Gujarat was the centre of production of a wide range of decorative objects decorated with or made from mother-or-pearl. These  were made for both the domestic market and for a regular export trade to the Middle East, Ottoman Turkey, Indonesia and Europe.\n\nDesign\nMother-of-pearl was one of the curious, exotic materials so highly prized in Renaissance courts. They were mounted in appropriately rich and fashionable settings of gold or silver-gilt. These  luxurious objects were intended for display, in collectors' cabinets or on sideboard arrangements.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe snail shell was carved to remove the hard outer layer and reveal the lustrous mother-of-pearl layers underneath. These layers were finely sliced into thin plaques and assembled. The centre of the bowl was made up of flat plaques to form a rosette, probably derived from the lotus flower motif. The sides were made from curved plaques. The plaques were pinned together with fine nails.\n%F dim_unit",
