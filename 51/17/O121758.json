This print was published in the 1830s, by which time the techniques of full-colour printing had been perfected. Prints such as this are sometimes called ukiyo-e, which means 'pictures of the floating world'. This world was one of transient delights and changing fashions centred on the licensed pleasure districts and popular theatres found in the major cities of Japan.\n\nSubject Depicted\nJoruri is a type of dramatic narrative chanting commonly associated with the bunraku puppet theatre. It flourished during the Edo period (1615-1868). Here, a beautiful woman is depicted against the backdrop of a joruri text. Pictures of beautiful women served as guides to and souvenirs of the faces and changing hair- and dress-styles of the women who worked in the pleasure quarters of Edo (modern Tokyo).\n\nMaterials and Making\nThe production of Japanese woodblock prints was a group activity orchestrated by a specialist publisher, in this case Iseya Rihei.  He commissioned the artist, Utagawa Kunisada, to produce a sketch. A detailed drawing based on this sketch was given to a block cutter, who created one block for the black outline of the image and further blocks for each of the colours to be used. These were passed to a printer. Pigments applied to the blocks were printed on to sheets of paper by rubbing from behind with a flat round disc known as a baren.",
