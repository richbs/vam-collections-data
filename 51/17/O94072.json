Choirbooks especially were produced in sets of many volumes. They often had more than 30. In 1457 Siena Cathedral decided to replace a set dating from the 13th century. The work lasted for more than 50 years. Cathedral archives record the names of some of the most outstanding illuminators of Italy. They came from all parts to undertake the work.\n\nFrom the early 19th century onwards, such choirbooks provided an easy source of images for connoisseurs. They sought them eagerly to add to their collections of paintings.",
