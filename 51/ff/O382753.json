Most are made of cast silver, and they are very difficult to date accurately, as the same designs were used unchanged for centuries.\n\nThis cross is very primitive in appearance, with its core of porphyry set in gilt metal mounts.  It was described as 16th century when it was acquired in 1866, but is more likely to be 19th century in date.  It hangs from a square bead with a stylised image of the face of Christ on the front, which is often used with Russian Orthodox pendants.  The image, called the Vernicle, is derived from a miraculous portrait which is said to have appeared on the Veil of Veronica after she wiped Christ's face with it on the road to Calvary.  It would originally have been worn on a long filigree chain.",
