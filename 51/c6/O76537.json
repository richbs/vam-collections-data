In this, a zigzag line is made by pushing a narrow chisel across the surface of the metal, and moving it from side to side. Wrigglework was not carried out by trained engravers, but by journeymen working in the pewterers' workshops, almost certainly to cut costs.\n\nMaker\nOnly a few pewterers used wrigglework, the maker identified by his stamped touch of crowned initials 'RS' being one of them. Either Robert Seare or Rowland Steward, he appears to have specialised in wares commemorating William and Mary. A tankard in the Museum bears the same touch mark, and almost identical decoration and technique. The designs seem to have been produced by using a stencil, although some large examples were probably carried out free-hand.\n\nDecoration\nThe portraits are contained within a central roundel, with the royal monogram of 'W' and 'M' intertwined before an 'R'. Patriotic themes were especially popular in the 1680s, and small plates were made for decoration and given as gifts to commemorate significant family events. The large na\u00efve designs are probably derived from the decoration of polychrome Dutch and English tin-glazed earthenware, and were an attempt by the pewterers to compete with the growing pottery industry in the production of commemorative items.",
