The St Neot's Museum opened in 1995 and Longsands Trustees transferred to it everything that fell within its collecting policy.  Since this did not, it was offered to us by the Trustees in March 2000 and accepted in June 2000. \n\nIt was presented to us by the Trustees of the Museum, one of whom wrote about it:\n'I do not know how it came to be in our museum but I hope to discover more about it when I next visit Longsands Museum on 9 & 10 May, though our record-keeping has notable gaps - our curator's untimely death has deprived us of our richest source of information.'  However, as at September 2000, no more information about its provenance has been received.",
