The subject was the tigress given to George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough by Lord Clive, Governor of Bengal who arrived in March 1762 in the menagerie at Blenheim.\nThe species shown is indeed an Indian or Bengal tigress with short fur and widely spaced stripes. Its small rounded head, short nose and lack of ruff indicate gender.\n\nAn identical mosaic is in a private collection in Genoa",
