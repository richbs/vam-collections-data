Cinderella comes complete with yellow and brown felt bonnet tied with orange ribbon under the chin and brown felt shoes, the right shoe has a hole in the toe which is supposed to be there to complete the scruffy, dirty look of 'Cinders'. This doll is complete with the Merrythought trademark mohair, a blonde wig underneath the bonnet. There is an embroidered label of Merrythought on the underside of the left foot. The doll has slightly dirty and blackened nose and forehead. The leg and arm are coming slightly unstitched in places and some of the material on the left leg has holes in, possibly due to moth damage.",

            "public_access_description": "Merrythought is an old term for a wishbone from a bird. Merrythought Toys opened their first factory in 1930 in Coalbrookdale, now Ironbridge. However Merrythought toys first began in 1919 when W.G.Holmes went into partnership with G.H Laxton and a small spinning mill was opened to make mohair yarn for the toys, which was imported from Turkey, South Africa and other areas. Some of the original employers for Merrythought were previously employed by Chad Valley. One particular employer was hearing impaired and mute, Florence Atwood, and went on to produce the entire range of toys for the first Merrythought line in 1931, some of which are still in production today. She became chief designer for Merrythought until her death in 1949.\nMGM studios in Hollywood worked with Merrythought to produce their characters in soft toy form. However by 1960 MGM wanted higher and higher royalties for their copyright characters and so the company stopped producing them for MGM.\nProduction ceased in the large factories during the war years, however they moved to nearby smaller factory spaces and continued to produce some of their toys.\nIn 1933 dolls were added to the production line. But by the 1950s dolls were not as important and animals once again took centre stage, particularly pyjama cases. In 1982 Merrythought began to export to the USA to meet the demands of the American teddy bear collector.\nThis Cinderella doll is part of the character dolls that Merrythought produced and in particular their Pantomime range.",
