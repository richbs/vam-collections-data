            "bibliography": "<u>Victoria and Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings Accessions 1957-1958 </u> London: HMSO, 1964\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>ANONYMOUS : Franco-Flemish School</b> \n\nDesign for a breastplate, showing a hero (?Mars) standing on a pedestal while being saluted by two women with a sword and a mace respectively.  The design also embodies two bound figures of captives, a heavily draped female figure, a cherub, grotesque animals, serpents, masks etc., the whole being linked by foliated arabesques.  The drawing shows the left half of the design, but is extended slightly on the right to include some variants in what would otherwise be a straightforward repetition.  The breastplate made from this drawing is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, where it forms part of an armour which was later passed into the collection of the Grand Dukes of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach at the Wartburg Armoury, Eisenach.  On the back of the drawing are slight pencil sketched which echo the forms of the arabesques on the front.  Franco-Flemish School, c.1555. \n<i>Inscribed in pencil on the mount</i> Coll. Spitzer.  <i>Numbered on a label attached to the mount</i> 3298 (<i>the number of the drawing when in the Spitzer Collection</i>). \n<i>Pen and ink wash.</i>                         E.5279-1958 \n\n<i>Note:</i> The drawing was formerly in the collection of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Spitzer, Paris, with another, in similar style, for the breastplate of the armour formerly associated with the Emperor Rudolph II (now associated by Bruno Thomas with the Emperor Maximillian II) in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, A drawing similar in design to E.5279-1958, but with variant details, was, in 1940, in the collection of Philip Hofer, Cambridge, Massachusetts.  There are further drawings related to the New York armour in the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung, Munich. \n\nE.5279-1958 was illustrated as Pl.II of the section entitled 'Miniatures et Dessins' (in which group it is numbered 25) of Vol.5 of the catalogue of <i>La Collection Spitzer</i>, Paris, 1892, and as Pl.18 in <i>Original-Zeichnungen Deutscher Meister des Sechzehnten Jahrhunderts</i> by J. H. von Hefner-Alteneck, Frankfort-on-Main, 1889. \n\nThe accession number of the armour in the Metropolitan Museum is 39.121 A-N (Dick Fund). \n\nFor relevant literature see: \n\nGrancsay, S.V.:  'A harness of a king of France', <i>Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York</i>, Vol.35, pp.12-16, 1940. \n\nGrancsay, S.V.:  'The armor of Henry II of France from the Louvre Museum', <i>Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New Series</i>, Vol.11, pp.68-80, 1952. \n\nThomas, Bruno:  'Neues zum Werk des Eliseus Libaerts', <i>Livrustkammaren (Journal of the Royal Armoury Stockholm</i>), Vol.4, p.311, 1946-8. \n\nThomas, Bruno:  'Die M\u00fcnchner Harnischvorzeichnungen im Stil Fran\u00e7ois ler', <i>Jahrbuch der Kunsthistorischen Sammlungen in Wien</i>, Vo.55 (New Series Vol.19, pp.31-74, 1959. \n\nCedestr\u00f6m, R. & \nSteneberg, K.E.: <i>Skokloster Sk\u00f6lden</i>, Stockholm, 1945. \n\nIllustrated as Pl.1817 in <i>L'Art Pour Tous</i>, Vol.7, Section 199, 30 March 1868.\"\nThomas, Bruno: 'Die M\u00fcnchner Harnischvorzeichnungen im Stil Fran\u00e7ois ler', <u>Jahrbuch der Kunsthistorischen Sammlungen in Wien</u>, Vo.55 (New Series1959 - Vol.19), pp.31-74.\nThomas, Bruno: 'Neues zum Werk des Eliseus Libaerts', Livrustkammaren', <u>Journal of the Royal Armoury Stockholm</u>, Vol.4 (1946-8), p.311.\nGrancsay, S.V.: 'The armor of Henry II of France from the Louvre Museum', <u>Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York</u>, New Series Vol.11 (1952), pp.68-80.\nGrancsay, S.V.: 'A harness of a king of France', <u>Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York</u>, Vol.35 (1940), pp.12- 16.",
