In 1998 she began printing soft-ground etchings on Japanese paper, using a bookbinding tool called a bone folder to draw. Made of bone, it is pointed at one end and wide and flat at the other so that it can make a range of marks from fine lines to broad strokes. \n\nUsing this technique Korf made several prints entitled \u2018Palingenesis\u2019 (genesis re-created). These are strongly formalist but suggest the inspiration of cave painting. Korf quotes the lectures of the art critic Herbert Read on the caves of Altamira, in which he suggested that the human ability to survive and evolve as the highest form of life is connected to the capacity to make images.\n\nSeen individually the prints are abstract but when placed side by side they assume the quality of landscape. The freedom of the lines suggests automatic writing but Korf is also influenced by the principles of Japanese calligraphy and her prints are often reminiscent of scroll paintings.",
