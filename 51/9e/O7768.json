            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis square tray, or 'salver' is one of two commissioned by Sir Robert Walpole to commemorate his terms as Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nOwnership & Use\nIt was a long-established custom for the holders of certain Crown offices to receive as a perquisite ('perk') the official silver seal of their office when it became redundant, as, for example, following the death of the sovereign.  The recipient commissioned a piece of silver engraved with the designs of the official seals.  Sir Robert Walpole was Chancellor of the Exchequer when George I died in 1727 and this salver is engraved with the design of the Second Exchequer Seal of George I.  The salver was eventually inherited by Sir Robert's youngest son, Horace.\n\nEngraved Decoration\nThe centre is engraved with the obverse, or front, and reverse of the Second Exchequer Seal of George I in use from 1724-1727.  The seal roundels are supported by a figure of Hercules, representing Heroic Virtue.  He is flanked by allegorical figures representing Calumny and Envy, with a view of the City of London in the background. The figures above represent Prudence and Fortitude. The elaborate strapwork border encloses masks representing the Four Seasons and has a cartouche in each corner. Each shows, within the Garter collar, the double cipher 'RW' appearing twice, the arms of Walpole quartering those of his first wife Catherine Shorter, and the Walpole crest of a Saracen's head.\n\nPeople\nThis salver was made by Paul de Lamerie (1688-1751), one of the leading goldsmiths of the time. The superb engraving is of the highest quality and is attributed to the renowned artist William Hogarth (1697-1764).",

The attribution to Hogarth was challenged by Phillips (1935), on no very good grounds, and again by Collins (Apollo, 1957), but more recently both Oman (1978) and Paulson (1970 and 1971) have argued forcibly for accepting Nichols' evidence. In January 1714, William Hogarth was apprenticed through the Merchant Taylor's Company  to the goldsmith, Ellis Gamble, as an engraver, for whom he later engraved a tradecard (ca. 1724). From 1720 when Hogarth set up shop, he spent a decade supporting himself as a jobbing engraver, engraving both silver and copper plates .... Apart from shopcards, he presumably worked for whichever goldsmith sent him orders; a single impression of Lamerie's own arms in the Royal Library is attributed to Hogarth and he engraved arms on silver for various clients, including the Duchess of Kendal, mistress of George I. A letterhead from Blundell's School (1726) and a benefit ticket for the actor Henry Milward (1728) ... \nIt has been suggested that Walpole might have specified Hogarth as the engraver of the salver, and it is true that the two men knew one another; one of the artist's early portraits (1728) was of Horace Walpole as a boy. But Lamerie's leading position in the trade and the business partnership between him and Hogarth's old master Ellis Gamble, as evidenced by their joint fire insurance policies for 1723-1728 is far more likely to be the explanation. The strongest evidence for the attribution to Hogarth is the close resemblance between the poses of the allegorical figures and those of the engravings known to have been Hogarth's work, such as the Gamble card and '<font -i>The Lottery</font>' (1724). They derive from Sir James Thornhill's paintings of the Protestant Succession in the Great Hall at Greenwich. These '<font -i>were running in my head</font>' during Hogarth's apprenticeship, an enthusiasm revived by his attendance at Thornhill's Academy from 1724.\nSource: exh. cat., <font -u>Paul de Lamerie</font>, Goldsmiths' Hall, London, 1990, No. 50 (P.

            "historical_context_note": "By the early 18th century it was a long-established custom for holders of crown office to commemorate their term of office with a piece of silver (a cup or a a salver), engraved with the design of their official seals. Its weight often corresponded approximately to the metal of the original silver matrices, which were a perquisite of office.",
