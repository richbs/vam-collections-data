This relief represents a basket of fruit and flowers and is framed with other Harmer reliefs. (A8, A11, A12, A13 and A13A-1919)\n\nThe reliefs were commonly inserted as ornamental decoration into the top section of a memorial, and were produced by Harmer in his native village of Heathfield. A variant of this relief was used twice on a memorial together with an example of the cherub relief. \n\nJonathan Harmer (1762-1849) was the son of Jonathan Harmer Senior (d. 1800) who bequeathed to his two sons Jonathan Jr and John 'all such Portland and other stone, together with my working Tools and utensils belonging to the Trade of a Stone Mason and Bricklayer, and Land Surveying Books.' In 1796 Jonathan Jr. left for America, settling in New York, where he worked with a mason and painter, returning to Heathfield in May 1800. His younger brother John had previously settled in New York, but also later returned to Heathfield. Jonathan Harmer Junior was working at Heathfield, Sussex, from 1800 till about the middle of the 19th century. He made reliefs by pressing a local terracotta into moulds. The squeezes were then touched up by hand and baked in a wood oven. A complete set of Harmer's terracotta reliefs is in the possession of the Sussex Archaeological Society at Lewes.",

According to Lucas, \"The stock consisted of a great number of the vases and paterae, two of the angel...., but with crown and rays, also the crown by itself, and one new pattern - a small coat-of-arms, those of the second Duke of Newcastle, Clinton, with Pelham in pretence'. These were inherited by Miss W.T. Lister, Heathfield Park, from her father, and she subsequently (in 1919) gave the present piece, together with cat. nos. 447 to 459, to the Museum, from this stock. Miss Lister also gave three examples of Harmer's pottery to the Department of Ceramics and Glass. A complete set of the pottery reliefs produced by Harmer was given in 1908 by Mr Alexander to the Archeological Museum of Sussex, now Sussex Archeological Society, located at Barbican/Anne of Cleves House, Lewes.",
