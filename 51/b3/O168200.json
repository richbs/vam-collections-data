Liston first played the role in a revival of the play at Drury Lane Theatre in 1823. An expert dancer, by the time he retired Liston was the highest-paid comedian on the London stage, earning between sixty and a hundred pounds a week at the Olympic Theatre, a huge salary for his day. He retired in 1837 after a career that spanned over thirty years.\n\nThe playwright Isaac Bickerstaffe (1733-1812) was principally engaged by David Garrick at Drury Lane Theatre as an adapter, and worked on adaptations of several French plays between 1756 and 1771. The Hypocrite,first produced in 1768, was perhaps his most successful adaptation. It was taken from Colley Cibber's Non-Juror, in turn a version of Moliere's Tartuffe. In his preface to the play Bickerstaffe noted that he had based the character Doctor Woolf on Moliere's Tartuffe. The character Maw-Worm was a new character however, originally introduced by Bickerstaff for the comedian Thomas Weston.",

The play was a version of Moliere's <i>Tartuffe</i> by way of Colley Cibber's <i>Non-Juror</i>, but the character of the fanatical evangelical preacher Maw Worm was Bickersfatt'es invention.  The play was revived at the same theatre on 7 May 1823 when Liston played the part.  It became one of his principal characters. Bloor Derby produced a porcelain figurine of him in the role.",
