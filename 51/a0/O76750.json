Very often his prints are a montage of photographic imagery overworked with painterly textures created through broad brush strokes of ink. His work is not only about, but literally made with, contemporary culture, in this case photograhic images taken from mass-produced magazines and other sources. He was one of the most influential and inventive artists of his era.",
