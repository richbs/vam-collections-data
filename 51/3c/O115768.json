Trimmed with a scalloped bobbin lace also of crewel wool and linen thread. Patterned with large floral sprigs of four different exotic flowers arranged in alternating rows (two per row).\n\nRound neck cut lower at the front, with curved front edges to give fullness at the bust, closing edge to edge, one long gusset in each front to give fullness over the hips. Wide shoulders with full sleeves deeply inset in the back panel which narrows to 7.5 cm at the waist. Side-back panels are set in under the arms. Elongated gussets at either side of the side-back panels and in the centre of the back panel give considerable fullness at the back. The very full sleeves are gathered into tiny wrist bands and decorated at the shoulders with lace-edged wings.\n\nThe front edges are faced with thick linen for 16 cm in the centre. A hook and eye has been later attached at the top of the facing (probably also a later addition). The jacket probably originally fastened with tie strings.",

The pattern of ornate and complex floral shapes was probably inspired by Italian woven silks of the same decade featuring similar designs.
