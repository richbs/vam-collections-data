His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMozart\u2019s opera Le Nozze di Figaro (The Marriage of Figaro) (1786)  was performed to celebrate the twenty-first anniversary of the Glyndebourne Festival Opera in 1955.  Critics praised Messel\u2019s exuberant pastiche of 18th-eighteenth century art and design \u2018The d\u00e9cor by Oliver Messel was in his richest and most inventive vein, fully emphasising the unique blend of sharp satire and human understanding for the folly and unhappiness of the characters which Mozart so perfectly caught in his music\u2019 (The Tatler, 22 June, 1955).  \n\nMessel\u2019s study for a tree shows his debt to 18th-century French and Italian landscape drawing and painting, with a typically feathery tree, loosely drawn in free pencil, ink and wash marks.  This monumental tree spanned the top and bottom of the back-cloth in the garden, Act IV.",
