Floors and walls, especially in the warm regions of central and southern Iran, were furnished with pavements and friezes of glazed tiles. Here the design was as popular as it was versatile and could be extended to cover all sizes of surface and provided a good base for carpets. The use of the matt black pigment prevents the colours from running into one another during the firing process, this technique is called cuerda seca.",
