            "public_access_description": "Liz Collini has an MA in Fine Art Printmaking from the Royal College of Art (graduated 2007). She is an artist who works with prints and drawings, making different forms of texts using simple but often ambiguous words and phrases in which word becomes image. She has described her work as follows: \"The written word holds many paradoxes, not least those of absence and presence. There are gaps and overlaps between reading and viewing, text and image, the hand and the machine. I try to create breathing spaces in which we can pause and look back at language. Whole narratives can be compressed into a single word or familiar phrase. The drawings' resemblance to plans and blueprints reflects the strange provisionality of written language; the things about which we write are always elsewhere. I work only with Times New Roman (the default font) and my own handwriting to minimise questions of typography.\" \n\nIn 2010, the V&amp;A commissioned Liz Collini to make a site-specific print for semi-permanent display in the Prints & Drawings Study Room. This was in due course donated by Robert Breckman: see E.328-2011). This print, 'neither one thing nor the other' was made for an exhibition in Portugal in 2010 (the Portuguese reads 'nem una coisa nem outra'), and was given to the V&amp;A by the artist to compliment the commissioned print.",
