            "physical_description": "1. model yacht; wood construction with the bottom of the keel a solid lead weight for balance. The hull has been repainted a cream colour with the top highly varnished wood. The top has a selection of loops and bridges of metal together with a hole for the mast for the rigging. Although repainted; the hull has a small number of scuffs and scratches. To the front is tied a ball of string wound on to a purple cardboard tube. 2. large sail; triangular white cotton with varnished dowel sticks attached with threads to two sides. One of the sticks has been broken and repaired with fine wire.\n3. small sail; triangular white cotton with a varnished dowel stick attached to one side with thread. \n4. mast; long length stick of varnished dowel; thicker than the other sticks and with various metal loops used for attaching the sails. \n5. short dowel stick; varnished; with a metal loop at one end and the other end cut away and shaped. \n6. box; plain wood with the lid hinged with two small metal hinges and held closed by two metal hooks. Printed in red on the top are the\nmaker's marks together with SIZE INCHES; RIG ; COLOUR . It maybe that the space have been written in with pencil but the markings are so faint that they can not be read. Inside the box are three blocks protected with pink felt used as housing for the yacht. The one over the bows swivels up to release the yacht.\n*Donor's letter; dated November 7; 1993 and attached to R/Ps together with signed Declaration of Gift. 'My maiden name was Dean (Daphne Olive); and I was born on 20th April 1927. My father gave the yacht as a birthday present; on my 7th or perhaps more likely my 8th birthday; i.e. 1934 or 35. We were living in Ilford at the time; and the idea was that I would sail the yacht on the pond in Valentine's Park. I did so on at least one occasion (and returned there with my daughter to do the same thing some time in the 1960s); but shortly afterwards my parents moved house to Harrow; and I don't think the yacht ever got such use. The yacht was not a personal request of mine as a gift; but I enjoyed looking at it and attaching the sails more than actually sailing it. I particularly appreciated the beautiful decking. My father was fond of woodwork; and I expect he pointed it out to me. I was conscious that the yacht was quite a valuable object; and was afraid of it sinking or getting stuck in the middle of a big pond. Also I was not allowed out to play on my own; or to go to the park with friends; so opportunities for sailing the yacht were limited. (These were I think quite ordinary middle-class type restrictions for a girl of 7 or 8 in those days. My parents were certainly not oppressive). I have conferred with my elder sister; and we remember that our mother and father frequently gave us separate gifts; which is probably why I am quite clear that the yacht came from my father; not from both my parents. He worked at the time in an import and export firm; and it is possible that he got some concession on the yacht. Most of our toys were not of that quality. I am glad that my yacht has now found a home in your collection.\nMy daughter died in 1983 and I have no other children.'",
