Mrs Gerelli, before her marriage, worked for a West End dressmaker, and this dress was a present from her appreciative employer. \n\nIn 2009, her great-grandson visited the Museum to view this dress. The family story is that Mrs Gerelli's parents were shopkeepers, and the dress was a gift from one of their suppliers. In 1968, Mrs Gerelli moved to Cornwall with her son and daughter in law, at which time the dress came to light, and was given to the daughters of the neighbours to wear for dressing-up. Their mother donated it to the V&A in the daughters' names rather than see the dress used for this purpose.",
