            "bibliography": "From departmental notes 'Two portions of a brass with effigy of monk, probably a Carthusian, in the Church of St. John de Sepulchre, Norwich. c. 1425. Given by the Rev. H. Tyrrell Green. Note: The remaining portions show the larger part of a fine canopy of the late Decorated or early Perpendicular period, with the internal cusping, external crockets, square flowered border, geometric wheel tracery in the spandril, and other ornamentation pointing to the period A.D. 1400-1450. Sufficient of the plate remains to show the two side shafts with canopied niches. Above the canopy there is an attempt to show by meabs of diagonal and horizontal lines a tiled or slated roof, and the underside of the canopy has a suggestion of vaulting. The panel contained between the canopy and two side shafts is closed by a grille, consisting of two square metal bars, arranged vertically, and an unknown number, probably four, of horizontal members, each in duplicate, the outer members of which are joggled to secure the uprights. Behind the grille appears appers about three -quarters of the effigy of man in habit of a monk, and with his hands clasped across the breast in the usual devotional manner. He wears the tonsure and also a cowl. (Extract from an article by H. O. Clarsk, \"Notes on Three Palimpsest Brasses recently discovered in Norfork\" in Norfolk\" in Norfolk Archaeology, 52 xxi, 1923.) For rubbings of later brasses cut from this original brass see E. 1360-1925 (a male civilian of c. 1535) and E. 1685-1918 (an effigy of a lady).'",
