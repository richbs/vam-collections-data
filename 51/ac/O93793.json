The photographs from this series, published in the book Actual Life are a sensitive record of life in this southern English county at the in the early years of the new millenium, across a range of people and subjects. This still life complements the portraits in the series, adding an extra dimension to Glanville\u2019s record of particular places and communities. The photograph shows the interior of a shop, perhaps a village post office. Using natural rather than flash light, Glanville picks out the greetings card counter while the rest of the shop is cast in shadow, and invests these banal objects with an extraordinary poignancy.",
