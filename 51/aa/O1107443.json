            "history_note": "This engraving featured in Thomas Bewick's first major independent publication, <i>A General History of Quadrupeds</i>, first printed and published in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1790. The publication contains illustrations of animals, alongside brief descriptions of their appearance, habits and habitats, accompanied by a number of illustrative vignettes, used mainly as tailpieces. This is possibly the second state of the engraving, which first appeared in the second (1791) edtion. \n\n\nThe text accompanying the illustration (in the publication) reads as follows: \n\n'<i>We have given the figure of this animal, drawn form one kept in the Tower; of which we have not been able to obtain any further description, than its being somewhat less than the Badger, almost without hair, extremely sensible of cold, and burrows in the ground. From these circumstances, as well as from the striking similarity of its figure to that of the Badger, we are inclined to think it is a variety of that animal, mentioned by naturalists under the name of the </i>Sow-Badger<i>. \nIts colour is a yellowish-white: Its eyes are small; and its head thicker than that of the common Badger: Its legs are short; and on each foot there are four toes, armed with sharp white claws. \nM. Brisson describes a white Badger, from New-York, so similar to this, that we suspect it to be the same species.</i>' \n\nTaken from: Beilby, Ralph and Bewick, Thomas. <u>A General History of Quadrupeds</u>. Newcastle upon Tyne. Third Edition, 1792.\n\nHistorical significance: Thomas Bewick was the first engraver to exploit fully the advantages of end-grain wood (the wood is cut across, rather than along, the grain). Once it had been proved that the technique could rival the fine effects of metal engraving, the advantages of wood engraving to the book trade were quickly recognised. Allowing both text and illustration to be printed in one operation, it ousted the intaglio process as the favourite for book illustration and was only superseded at the end of the nineteenth century when methods of photomechanical reproduction were developed.",
