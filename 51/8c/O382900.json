They were often worn in extravagant quantities, at the collar and cuff, as well as to fasten shirts, jackets, waistcoats, coats and cloaks.  \n\nThese buttons, linked together in a pair, were used to hold the neck of the shirt closed.  The use of buttons as collar links precedes their use in fastening clothes in most European countries.  They come from Norway, and were mainly worn, by both men and women, in the Setesdal valley, particularly from Valle.  The round link is typical of northern Europe.  In southern Europe the links were usually oval in shape.\n\nThey were bought for six shillings (the pair) at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
