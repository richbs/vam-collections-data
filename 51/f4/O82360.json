He moved to London in 1836 and exhibited his first works at the Royal Academy in 1841. These were miniatures painted on marble, as is this example. For these seven works he was awarded a medal for 'inventing' the painting of miniatures on marble. He was not, however, the first to do so. Jean Fran\u00e7ois Marie Huet Villiers painted on alabaster and marble as well as the traditional ivory. Born in Paris, he came to England in the early 19th century.",
