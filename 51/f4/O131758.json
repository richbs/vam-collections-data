Like all schools of the time, it was only for boys. The Theatre Royal was built by the actor-manager Samuel Butler in 1788, and managed by him as party of  his circuit of theatres at Beverly, Harrogate, Kendal, Northallerton, Ulverston and Whitby.  Like all circuit theatres, it would not have had a resident company but would have been visited by companies such as this who travelled to several theatres in the circuit.",
