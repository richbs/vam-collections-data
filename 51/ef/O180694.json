Since tea caddies were placed on the table as tea was served, they were often highly decorative.  A great variety of wooden caddies were made between 1780 and 1810 as tea became cheaper and more widely used.  A. Hepplewhite & Co. published designs for both \u2018tea caddies\u2019 and \u2018tea chests\u2019, which were usually larger, in The Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer\u2019s Guide, 1788 (2nd edition 1789, 3rd Edition 1794). \n\nThis caddy is veneered in satinwood with inlaid neoclassical decoration in the form of oval paterae, in coloured and stained woods on the front and lid. It has two lidded compartments inside for storing different varieties of tea.",

Early tea containers were referred to as canisters, kept in locked boxes known as tea chests. Smaller wooden boxes with one or two fixed inner compartments for loose tea became popular from about 1780 onwards and by 1800 were generally known as tea caddies. The word 'caddy' is thought to derive from the Malay word for a measure of weight (<i>kati</i>) equivalent to about half a kilogram.",
