Smaller in the 1760s and 1770s, they grew to substantial size in the 1780s and 1790s, and were often chosen as a focus for satirising in caricatures of fashion. \n\nFur was often used to cover muffs as an obvious source of warmth, sometimes worn with a matching fur tippet, but as they could be carried on all occasions including formal ones, fine silk muffs were also available, usually white or pastel-coloured satin decorated with delicate embroidery, like this example. The Gentleman's and London Magazine noted in 1777  'Muffs are worn long and slender, of plain white satin, tamboured and ornamented with furs sewn on in serpentine forms round the muff and intermixed with spangles and large bows of ribbon at each end'.",
