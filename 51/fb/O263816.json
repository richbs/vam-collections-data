Strips of cotton woven by men are stitched together to form a cloth which is then discharge dyed by women.  The cloth is first dyed yellow using a plant dye, the pattern is then made on the cloth using mud that has been fermented for up to a year.  The mud reacts with the dye turning a dark brown. Once the mud has dried it is washed off with water.  At this point the design shows up in yellow against a dark back ground.  A caustic solution is then carefully painted over the yellow design and left to dry for a week, when it is washed off the yellow has turned white and the cloth is finally complete.",
