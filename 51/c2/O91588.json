Until recently the tankard was classed as Danish by an unidentified maker (see Oman). The mark however is certainly that of Nieman. Nieman was born around 1630, and worked from 1679 in Stromso, where he died in 1721.\nStromso incorporated in 1615 lies on the south side of the Drammen River and now forms part of the modern town of Drammen. The ironmaster Jens Olufsen Bruun, whose name is inscribed on this tankard together with that of his wife Anna Dorthea Povelsdatter (d. 1709) was born c. 1653 and was buried on 29 July 1707. He was joint owner of the Hasel ironworks in Eiker and from 1691 to 1699 tenant of the ironworks at Kongsberg. In addition he owned the estate of Berg near Kongsberg. By his wife he had 5 children, one of whom was the Olle Jensson Bruun whose name is also inscribed on the tankard. Olle was purveyor to the silver mines and died in 1714. ... It is likely that the medallion is a later addition.\n\nText for press: An exceptional example from a fine collection of Scandinavian silver in the V&A, one of the Museum's great strengths (along with German, Spanish and Portuguese silver).
