One of her innovations is the fusion inlay with platinum and gold. She continues to push the boundaries of goldsmithing techniques to find a new expression, as here with her combination of gold and titanium. \n\nTitanium was a new material developed through experiments in the space industry. Its iridescent colour, achieved through heat or electrical currents, attracted the attention of jewellery designers, such as Mina.\n\nJacqueline Mina writes in the foreword of a catalogue to the exhibition 'Or Gold', which she curated in 2004: \"I know from my own practice that gold as an artistic medium is an undeniably versatile metal and that many imaginative artists choose to use it for its limitless physical possibilities. In addition to the appreciation of its natural characteristics they find that their jewellery is endowed with an allure that is carried down from antiquity in the collective subconscious.\"",
