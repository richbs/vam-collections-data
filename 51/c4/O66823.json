The core of the bench is made from slabs of expanded polystyrene.  These were glued together and inserted into a loosely woven fabric bag that had been saturated in blue liquid resin.  Then it was placed in a vacuum chamber.  The vacuum forced the air out of the polystyrene, shrinking and distorting it.  Simultaneously the liquid resin was drawn into the polystyrene, bonding the fabric cover to the core.  Once the resin dried as a hard shell, the bench was complete.  Each example, though made with uniform synthetic materials, would distort in different ways, making every bench unique. It is relatively durable, extremely lightweight, and fully expresses the process that made it.",
