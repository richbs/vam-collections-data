It was worn with a matching toque hat designed by John Boyd. While her mother, Queen Elizabeth II, went to couturiers such as Norman Hartnell or Hardy Amies. Anne went to the ready-to-wear firm Susan Small. This coat was designed for her by Maureen Baker, the company's head designer since 1943.  Classic tailoring was updated with a fashionable mini length for the then nineteen year old Princess.\n\nSusan Small was a British ready-to-wear firm, founded in the early 1940s by Leslie Carr Jones. In the 1970s it was bought by Courtaulds, the large textile manufacturers. Baker started her own company 'Maureen Baker Designs' in 1978, following Susan Small's closure.",
