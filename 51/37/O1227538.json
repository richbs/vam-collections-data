            "public_access_description": "This video games console was the first 128-bit console on the market (the sixth-generation era, including the Sony Playstation 2, Nintendo GameCube and Microsoft Xbox), and the first to introduce Internet gaming. It was released in Japan at the end of 1998, and in the rest of the world from September 1999. On its launch in North America, it sold 500,000 consoles in two weeks, being hailed as the first console to move beyond the 'hardcore' gamer and into the mass market. However, with the announcement of Sony's PlayStation 2 in March 1999, a year ahead of its actual release, Sega's market began to slow, with gamers beginning to wait to see who which console would dominate. The Dreamcast was created to be a games console only, and with PlayStation 2's DVD capabilities, this was seen as a more attractive option for people wanting to enter the home theatre market. \nThe free Internet gaming service, in Europe called Dreamarena,  provided users with the option to play against one another remotely. This was the first time that a console was capable of this function, and was highly publicised at the time. It has since become a feature of all manufacturer's consoles, but although the Dreamcast was first with this function, it did not compete with the technical offerings of Sony's Playstation 2. It could not sustain the Dreamcast, which Sega discontinued in March 2001, leading Sega to completely remove itself from the home console market after 18 years and to concentrate on producing games for other manufacturers.\n\nIncluded with this set are two peripheries for the controller, including a Visual Memory Unit (VMU) and a Rumble Pack, or Jump Pack. The rumble pack was originally designed by Nintendo for its N64 system (preceding the Dreamcast as a fifth generation console). It is now integral to gaming, and gives a vibrating buzz to the controller during certain actions during play. The VMU was intrinsic to the Dreamcast: its most basic function was as a memory unit, but when plugged into a Dreamcast controller, its LCD display could be seen through the square hole in the controller, giving added visuals to the gaming experience relating to the game currently being played. Furthermore, on its removal from the controller, it could be used as a seperate handheld gaming device, with its own controller and screen, and minigames could be downloaded from the main games played using the Dreamcast.",
