The production, with its white box, bright primary colours, trapezes and unequivocal sexual approach was a seminal production that proved a huge hit with audiences first at Stratford and London and on subsequent tours around the world.\n\nHistorical significance: The dress is of considerable importance as Kestelman was the original Titania and wore the dress for the performances in Stratford, London and New York and on the subsequent US tour.  The Museum already owns the design for the costume, along with the designs for several other characters, and various properties, including the famous spinning plate that was the magic flower.",
