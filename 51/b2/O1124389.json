Isabella or Isabelle Granger was born in Essex in 1906, the daughter of Harold Granger and his wife (n\u00e9e Isabella Rebecca Dodd) and died in London in 1990.  The bequest came via her solicitors who could give no information about her or the garments.  It has since been possible to trace her parents' names and the date of her birth, and it is probable that the clothes were worn by her and/ or her sister Brynhild Katharine (born 1908) as a child.",
