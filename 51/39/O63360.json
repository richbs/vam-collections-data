The tirthankara is seated in padmasana pose on a cushion supported by a lion throne in the centre of which is an engraved  goose (bird) parcially overlaid with silver, and on other side of which are the yaksa and yaksi.   Two smaller tirthankara figures stand before the framework of the back of the throne on either side of the main image.  To the outside of the standing  figures and above the yaksa and yaksi are two chauri bearers.  The crossbar of the back of the throne is decorated with inlaid silver and ends in each side with a makra head.  The two seated tirthankara figures form part of an arch which includes two elephants supporting the canapy over the head of the main image.   The top of the canopy and part of the back of the throne are overlaid with silver. On either side of the now missing finial at the top of the torana remain two conchs.  At the front of the pedestal upon which the throne rests are two deer flanking a dharmachakra, the nine planets, and two worshippers.\nOn the reverse is engraved a devanagi inscription which reads:\n\" This image of Sri Sumatinatha, installed by Sri Laksmisagarasuri of the Tapa Gachchha on the 6 th day of the bright half of Magha in V.S.1523 ( which corresponds with 11th January 1467 A.D.) was caused to be made by the merchant Sadha, a member of the Pragavat community, resident in Nahisara together with his wife Sahajalade and son Rajaka and his wife Rajaladevi and son Lasmana ( for the purification and merit of their family?).\"",
