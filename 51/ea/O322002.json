The most obvious expression of this is in the cradles and high chairs of the youngest children, who in their smallness and vulnerability need the most help.\n\nThe earliest known printed use of the phrase 'high chair' in the UK is surprisingly late: in Thackeray's novel 'Vanity Fair', first published in 1848 \"Little Rawdon..was perched on a high chair by the baronet's side.\"  But high chairs had been in use since at least the 1670s, in the format of a small chair on elongated legs; the child would normally be tied securely into the chair, even where a safety bar was fitted to the front.  While the chair could be pushed up to a table at mealtimes if wished, and played a significant part in socialising and amusing its occupant, it was probably considered most important in terms of convenience for the adult carer and as a means of keeping the pre-walking child safe.",
