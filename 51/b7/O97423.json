They were once part of an elaborate field armour (an armour for fighting) made in around 1550 for the Spanish nobleman, Don Alba de Bemont Dassa. \n\nThe steels were made by Anton Peffenhauser (1525-1603), one of the most renowned of the south German armourers of the sixteenth century. He worked not only for the Spanish nobility but also for the Electoral Courts of Saxony. A good armour by Pfeffenhauser would cost around 200 thalers, in contrast to an ordinary foot soldier's armour which would cost around 6 thalers.\n\nThe steels were etched by a specialist, Jorg Sorg (working 1517 - ca. 1564), whose album of work survives in the State Library in Stuttgart.\n\nArms and armour are rarely associated with art. However, they were influenced by the same design sources as other art forms including architecture, sculpture, goldsmiths' work, stained glass and ceramics. These sources had to be adapted to awkward shapes required to perform complicated technical functions. Armour and weapons were collected as works of art almost as much as military tools.",

The striking difference in preservation suggests that they must have been separated for a long time.\n\nHistorical significance: Anton Peffenhauser is one of the most renowned of the south German armourers of the sixteenth century, working not only for the Spanish nobility but also for the Electoral Courts of Saxony. He was born in around 1525 and began working in Augsburg by the mid 1540. He was also a great arms and armour merchant and was not above circumventing guild regulations to fulfil orders. He grew so rich that in 1556 he became a member of the Great Council of Augsburg. The guild, which had no power to enforce its restrictions on him,  elected him to the position of warden in 1563. A good armour for the joust made by Pfeffenhauser would cost around 200 thalers, in contrast to an ordinary foot soldier's armour which would cost around 6 thalers.",
