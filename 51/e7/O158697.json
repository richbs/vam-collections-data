Unlike formal white wedding dresses, these could be worn again after the ceremony. As clothes rationing took hold, it proved sensible for many brides to buy practical outfits that represented value for money. This suit, in soft blue-grey wool cr\u00eape, was worn for a wedding at St Giles' Church, Rowley Regis. The bridegroom wore his Army uniform.\n\nThe sharply tailored, wide-shouldered jacket of this suit is typical of the wartime silhouette. The dress underneath has short puffed sleeves, and could be worn without the jacket on warm days. This suit was made before 1942, the year in which strict fabric regulations were implemented. The decorative self-fabric pocket details and number of buttons would not have met with these new restrictions, which controlled fabric usage and fastenings. Fur was not rationed, so the grey astrakhan yoke of the jacket represents a wartime luxury.",
