The design was a very popular one in Britain between the 1750s, when it was introduced, and about 1800. Cabbage-leaf jugs could have a pouring lip formed as a mask or a plain cylindrical neck. They were first made at the Worcester porcelain factory, and then at Lowestoft, Caughley and several of the Liverpool factories. The design was also copied in Chinese porcelain for export to Europe. They are described as 'Dutch Jugs' on a Worcester porcelain price list of about 1755-1756.\n\nPeople\nThis jug was made at Caughley in Shropshire, but decorated at Robert Chamberlain's enamelling workshop in Worcester. Chamberlain (1736-1798) had been apprenticed to learn 'pot painting' at the Worcester porcelain factory, where he was in due course put in charge of the 'ornamental part of the production.' Around 1786 he left the factory and started his own business in the same city. At first he ran this as a decorating studio, working as a sub-contractor for Caughley, but he also bought Caughley wares and decorated them for re-sale on his own account.",
