            "public_access_description": "This satirises the relationship between The Duke of Clarence (later William IV) and his mistress, Dorothea Jordon. It was published in 1821, five years after the death of  the actress and three years after he married Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen. It plays on the idea of the possible guilt felt by The Duke due to his treatment of  Mrs Jordan who is depicted rising from her coffin. She was one of the first 'royal' residents of Paris in the period covered by the exhibition. She lived in France for the last two years of her life, first in Boulougne, later in Versailles and finally Saint Cloud, escaping debts in England caused by her son-in-law. She was buried in Saint Cloud Cemetery but due to her financial situation, the funeral expenses were never paid by her or her descendants and were paid by the people of Saint Cloud as is made clear in the print.\n\nMrs Jordan was painted and sculpted by eminent artists and sculptors throughout her career as an actress in England, but was also featured in scores of satirical prints after 1791 and the start of her affair with the Duke of Clarence. The relationship lasted for twelve years and resulted in ten children. Public interest in their affair was naturally heightened by his royal status and hers as Britain's leading comic actress.  The academic portraits of Mrs Jordan glorified her position as much as the satirical prints vilified her reputation.",
