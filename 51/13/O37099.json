This design was made for the pantomime, Dick Whittington and His Cat, at the London Palladium, 22 December 1980. The production was directed by Lionel Blair.  Sarah the Cook was played by Mollie Sugden, who was then enjoying great success as Mrs Slocombe in the television situation-comedy, Are You Being Served?\n\nHistorical significance: An example of pantomime costume design of the second half of the 20th century and of the work of a designer who specialised in pantomime and variety design. It is an example of a costume design for a pantomime dame and is unusual in being a design for a female dame. It also illustrates a feature of pantomime in the 20th century: the employment of television stars in leading roles.",
