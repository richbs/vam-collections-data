The top rail is carved with crochets and terminates in the centre in machicolations. The bottom of each light is pierced with a quatrefoil. The uprights of the back are carved as panelled buttresses terminating in pyramidical caps. The arms, which are inclined outwards, are filled with a Gothic arcade of 'Early English' type; the angles are carved with a Rococo flower. The front legs are carved as cluster columns with square bases. The covering is embroidered with the figure of a woman in Turkish costume, within conventional foliage, now much faded.",
