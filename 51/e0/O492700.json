Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all  they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes  (himotoshi) on the  bottom of the sandal. Although netsuke were  made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this netsuke of a demon's arm. \n\nThis design represents the legend of Watanabe no Tsuna, an eleventh century warrior who sought to free the capital city of Kyoto from a terrifying demon residing at the Rashomon Gate. Waiting by the gate at nightfall Watanabe no Tsuna cut off the demon's arm as it appeared in front of him. The demon then fled the capital leaving his severed arm behind. Netsuke representing the same legend can also include a small demon weeping over the limb.",
