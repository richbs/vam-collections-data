His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel designed two versions of Mozart\u2019s opera The Magic Flute (1791), at Covent Garden Opera Trust (1947) and at Glyndebourne (1956), for which he adapted his designs from 1947.  These productions were two of the first three stagings of this opera after the end of World War II.   Some reviewers found his designs elegant and a fantastic spectacle; however, others found the designs too fussy and elaborate for the small Glyndebourne stage.\n  \nAccording to a newspaper reporter (Daily Telegraph, 1 June 1956),  Messel\u2019s costume for Sarastro, the High Priest of the Temple of Isis and Osiris, was inspired by African priest\u2019s robes he saw on a visit to Uganda in 1955,  the year before designing The Magic Flute for Glyndebourne.",

Oliver Messel\u2019s production was first performed at the Royal Opera House, London, by the Covent Garden Opera Trust on 20 March 1947.  It was directed by Malcolm Baker-Smith and featured Kenneth Neafe as Tamino and Victoria Sladen as Pamina.  This was the first opera that Messel designed.  Messel created new costume and set designs for a Glyndebourne production, first presented 19 July, 1956.  Directed by Carl Ebert, Ernst H\u00e4efliger played Tamino, Pilar Lorengar was Pamina and Drago Bernardic was Sarastro.\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: Oliver Messel's first costume and set designs for an opera production was in 1947; however, this design is probably for the Glyndebourne production of 1956, during Messel's run as a Glyndebourne theatre designer from 1951 to 1959.",
