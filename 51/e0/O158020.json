Three short straps in the form of female demifigures and foliage connect the border to the base of the stem. The vase-shaped stem is chased on the lower part with cartouches and fleur-de-lis and is further decorated with three applied female masks; the upper stem is fluted and embellished with three openwork brackets with applied masks. The cylindrical rock-crystal bowl rests in a bulbous mount chased with basketwork and stylized fruit, with applied female figures. The spreading lip is decorated with similar chased fruit, applied medallions in the form of female masks, and an engraved band of strapwork and foliage. The upper and lower parts of the bowl are connected by three straps formed as caryatid demifigures above fluting, with lion masks applied at their midpoint. The raised cover is embossed with a band of strapwork, masks, and fruit on a matted ground, with applied bosses chased with basketwork, and is stamped around the border with gadroons. In the centre of the cover is a rock-crystal boss set into a stamped surround with applied brackets similar to those of the foot. The later tripod scroll finial is surmounted by a fluted vase. The interior of the cover is engraved with a laurel wreath containing the bust of a warrior.",

During the Reformation precious metal from many old reliquaries was melted down and rock-crystal components reused. This cup was possibly made by the royal goldsmith, Affabel Partridge. In about 1824 it was restored and given by the Duke of Wellington to his godchild Lady Clementina Villiers at her christening.\n\nThis object would once have been part of the buffet. The buffet of plate was an important feature of medieval and Renaissance banquets. Often made of oak or walnut, buffets usually stood at the side of a dining room, their shelves filled with tablewares. Gold and silver vessels were displayed to convey a sense of the owner's wealth. Normally these vessels were used for the service of food and drink, but on great state occasions they would be set out purely for display. \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
