It is framed in the manner favoured by John Jones for his collection of enamels by Petitot. (1) Perhaps the frame indicates that Joseph bought the miniature as a weed-out from Jones, or more likely from an intermediate collector. Either way, the miniature would have seemed ill at ease posing as a courtly French enamel, and Carl Winter summarily re-catalogued it as <i>An Unknown Man in a brown Periwig</i> and attributed it to 'Lawrence Crosse', i.e., Peter Cross. \nThe format is unusually small for Cross, but the hand is certainly his of about 1680-5. \n\n1 Of which the standard catalogue is still that by Long (1923).\" \n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1941</u>, London: HMSO, 1954.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n<b>'CROSSE, Lawrence (d. 1724)\n</b>\nMiniature portrait of an unknown man wearing a brown periwig.<i>\nOn parchment on card. Oval.</i>\nP.9-1941\n\nGiven by Mrs. Samuel S. Joseph.'",
