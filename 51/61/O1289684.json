Formed in 1966 by david Queensberry, then Professor of Ceramics at the RCA, and his former student Martin hunt. the partnership have designed ceramics for major producers and retailers around the globe. these include Wedgewood, Hornsea, Rosenthal, Habitat, Crate and Barrel, John Lewis and Jamie Oliver. Their practice spans a period of immense change in the industry, brought about by the adoption of new technologies, and the shift in production towards East Asia. Working in an essentially modernist aesthetic, Queensberry Hunt have been responsible for some of the most familiar and best-selling tableware of recent decades.\nIn the late 1990s, Queensberry Hunt returned to the issue of contemporary international dining. They developed a comprehensive new range of tableware that absorbed the shapes conceived for \u2018Asia\u2019 and employed the linear decorative motifs made popular with \u2018Trend\u2019. The resulting range, \u2018Loft\u2019, which incorporates square, oval, and round shapes, has become one of the Rosenthal Group\u2019s most successful products.",
