In 1861 he worked in Gustave Courbet's studio for several months as a pupil. After a period of portraiture, Fantin-Latour concentrated on flowers paintings and still-lifes for which he is now best known. His flower pieces were especially popular with British collectors, and he exhibited at the Royal Academy in London from 1862 onwards, especially thanks to the patronage of James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903), whom he met in 1858.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Fantin-Latour's paintings of flower, a category in which he progressively specialised executing up to 500 floral compositions. This painting shows a stem of white lilies whose pure white contrasts against the plain dark background. This effect of light and colour are characteristic of the new naturalism developed in French art in the second half of the 19th century, which anticipate the Impressionists' new experimentations.",

The simple, uncluttered painting captures the structure of the flowers perfectly: the six fold symmetry, the long curving styles, and the anthers shedding pollen that stains the petals a rich rusty yellow. The flowers are not \"pure glistening white\", however, but faintly streaked with purple. <i>L. candidum</i> is quite variable in the wild and many garden forms have been selected in Europe, including a purple striped variety.'",

            "history_note": "Bought in 1882 from Mrs Ruth Edwards as a 'school example'.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting was probably painted in Paris in Fantin-Latour's studio. It shows a stem of white lilies silhouetted against a a dark plain background, the motif being cut off on the bottom edge. It is one of the three paintings the South Kensington School of Design, now Victoria and Albert Museum, acquired as a model for its students (see also S.Ex.24-1884 and S.Ex.4-1889). They all share the characteristic of presenting a single plant rather than a bouquet, depicted without a vase or table, on a plain background. In these three pictures, the artist focused his attention on the contrast between the brilliant colours of the flowers and the plain neutral background pervading thus the picture with a strong luminosity. Whereas the other two paintings present a luminous background and intense colours, here the light effect came from the contrast between the pure white of the lilies and the plain background bathed in the shade, making this painting an obvious studio piece.\n\nThe Barbizon School and the Impressionists engendered a new interest for naturalism and the objective rendering of light and colours. However,  Fantin-Latour did not share their enthusiasm for open air painting and most of his compositions were executed in his studio.\n\nThis painting was purchased from Mrs Elizabeth Ruth Edwards, who was acquainted with Fantin-Latour as she and her husband hosted the artist for a few months in their house at Sunbury-on-Thames in 1861. On this occasion, Fantin-Latour executed her portrait, now in the Mus\u00e9e du Petit-Palais, Paris. Mr and Mrs Edwards became his dealers in England and their friendship with the painter is witnessed by his portrait of them dated 1875, now in the Tate Gallery, London (F.738).",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists.",
