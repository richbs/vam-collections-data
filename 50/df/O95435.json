This medal has only the obverse which represents busts of \"Stefan Praun and his wife Margaretha\" facing right, Stefan, bearded and bare-headed, Margaretha wearing a flat hat. \n\nThis medal and the stone model from which it may have been cast (inv. 188-1867) purport to represent Stefan II Praun, the father of Paul Praun, and his first with Margatrtha. They are however based on the anonymous medal of Albrecht and Dorothea of Prussia. This medal is itself based on two earlier medals dated 1526 showing Albrecht and Dorothes separately. These were attributed to a anonymous Master of Duke Albrecht by Habich. Habich did not list this medal but he attributed the stone model for it to Gebel, and said that it represented Duke Albrecht of Prussia and his wife Dorothea, evidently because of its resemblance to the authentic medals portraying these rulers. The altered inscription and minor changes in the costume and elsewhere suggest that this medal is a later pastiche, probably produced during the first half of the 19th century.",
