FHA Wallop; lent to the Museum, 24 February 1931 until 1949; given to Alan Evans, June 1933, and by him bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.)  \n \nDescribed by Wallop as 'Artist Unknown', the miniature was labelled accordingly in the Museum and identified as a 'supposed portrait' of Robert Dormer, 1st Earl of Carnarvon (c.1610-43). Carl Winter added a note in October 1945: 'This seems to be an old copy of a superb miniature (?by Alexander Cooper, or ??late Peter Oliver) belonging to Lord Glenconner.' (1) Recent examination shows that the miniature is not an old copy in the sense intended by Winter; the gumminess of the medium and the mode of Simulating a proper carnation ground seem characteristic of pseudo sixteenth- and seventeenth-century miniatures produced around the middle of the nineteenth century.  \n \nWinter's uncertainty about the authorship of the ex-Glenconner original is fair, but the weight of evidence is that his first thought of Alexander Cooper was right. The portrait should date, on costume, from the mid-1630s, when this pattern of Flemish bobbin-lace, with the broad rounded scallops, was current. Although the Glenconner miniature bears an apparently old inscription P Oliver / Carnarvon, Peter Oliver's technique by this date was one of softly blended stipple, not this relatively crisp and focused hatch. In terms of graphic technique, bold colour and use of gum it seems more easily compatible with signed Alexander Cooper works of the period, such as Charles Louis, Count Palatine (Cat. No. 55).  \n \nThe Glenconner identification of the sitter as Carnarvon seems to be no more reliable. Carnarvon, a devoted royalist and accomplished soldier killed at the first Battle of Newbury, was the sort of man whose name was bound to become attached to unidentified portraits in the eighteenth- and nineteenth-centuries. The standard portrait of him is the Van Dyck in his father-in-law's house at Wilton; it bears little or no relation to this image.  \n \nThe present identification as Philip, 5th Earl of Pembroke is due to Malcolm Rogers.(2) who suggests that the Carnarvon identification as Philip may have been due to a family muddle, Carnarvon being the husband of Anna Sophia, the eldest daughter of the 4th Earl of Pembroke, and therefore brother-in-law of Philip, 5th Earl of Pembroke. Rogers notes that the colour of the hair in the miniature is right for the 5th Earl, and that there is a marked resemblance of feature between the likeness in the miniature and that in Van Dyck's closely contemporary 'Great Piece', the Family of the 4th Earl of Pembroke (Wilton House, Wiltshire; 1635/6), and in the slightly later three quarter length of Philip alone, also by Van Dyck at Wilton. In January 1634/5, Philip, who was the fourth son of his father, became the heir apparent on the death of his elder brother Charles (the third son - the two eldest having died in infancy) of smallpox in Florence. \n\n1 Wallop Loan Book. \n2 Personal communication, 1993.\"",
