Some examples used camels, monkeys or people as figures of fun, completely abandoning any relevance and entering the realms of novelty and sometimes of impracticability.\n\nPeople\nWilliam Brownfield (died 1873)  was from 1836 a partner in Wood & Brownfield  at Cobridge.  He became sole owner from 1850 and was joined in 1871 by his son William Eccles Brownfield, who ran the company from 1873 until his retirement in 1890. Then the company was converted into a co-operative, as the Brownfield Guild Pottery Society Ltd.  This failed in 1898 and in 1900  the works was closed down and demolished.  During their heyday the Brownfields made a wide variety of different types of ceramic, including majolica-glazed earthenwares, stoneware, Parian (a type of unglazed white 'statuary' porcelain ), porcelain and p\u00e2te-sur-p\u00e2te (a form of applied relief decoration).  Over 600 workers were employed in the 1870s, and much of the production was exported to America.\n\nDesign & Designing\nBasketweave was a favourite relief pattern and was registered as early as 1855.  Thereafter the pattern was used in many guises. Brownfield & Son first appointed an art director in 1872, but even at the much earlier date of 1868 design was taken seriously. This design was registered in that year, apparently under the completely unrelated name of 'Westminster', which appears on this teapot.",
