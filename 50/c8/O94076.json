It would have stood on top of a column or pillar, at the top of which was a square capital, neither of which have survived. Much Wenlock Priory was a Cluniac establishment (founded 1079 and 1082), built on the site of an earlier church founded in 680 by Merewalh, King of the Magonsaete, whose daughter was canonized. St. Milburga was buried here.\n\nNorthern European lecterns were usually made of wood or metal. This is one of only three 12th century surviving lecterns in England made from stone that came from Shadwell Quarry near Wenlock. All are decorated with foliage and animal heads. Though without specific iconography to indicate its location, it probably sat near the High Altar to support liturgical books rather than in the Refectory where monks were read to during meals.",

St. Milburga was buried here.\n\nOnly three 12th-century lecterns survive in England, the others being at Norton (from Evesham Abbey) and Crowle, both in Worcestershire. This, however, is the oldest of the three. This is perhaps indicative of there being a local fashion for lecterns of this type in this area. White marble lecterns, meanwhile, are found in considerable numbers on Romanesque pulpits in Italy. In Northern Europe they were usually made of wood or metal, and this limestone, a kind of rock made up chiefly of carbonate of calcium, example seems to be indicative of a local fashion for Italianate lecterns in this area.\n\nThe carving of the foliage and masks adorning the sides of the lectern is satisfyingly fleshy and substantial, which makes the piece a classic example of first-class English Romanesque sculpting.\n\nPurchased by Private Treaty Sale from the Trustees of the Wenlock Abeey Estate for \u00a346,500, in 1984.",
