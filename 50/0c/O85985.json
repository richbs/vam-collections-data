            "physical_description": "Wooden doll called 'Benny', dressed as a boy in a jacket, short trousers and shirt\n[Doll] The doll is made entirely of wood, with a carved and painted head and lower limbs.  The head, neck and shoulders are painted cream, and the short hair with centre parting at the front is painted in dark brown; the eyes are lightly marked, and the nose (finished with a nail) and the closed mouth are carved.  The arms are straight with a ridge at the wrist, and are jointed at the shoulders by nailing to a transverse wooden rod loosely threaded through the upper body.  The true left arm is painted cream, with a straight hand and separated fingers; the true right arm is painted to match but only on the forearm and hand, which is curved, with the fingers marked.  The baluster-shaped body is tapered, with the back waist and the curve of the buttocks indicated.  The legs are jointed at the thighs using the same method found on the 18th century wooden dolls, with a wooden dowel running across the body and legs and pegged into the lower hips.  The legs are slightly curved at the knees, with the feet and lower legs painted dark brown to represent heeled boots (or possibly heeled shoes with dark hose).\n[Doll's clothing] Collarless single-breasted jacket of navy blue serge lined with blue/ white/ black striped cotton.  The jacket is straight cut, has wrist-length sleeves and an unpressed back neck pleat, and originally fastened at the front with three buttons and stitched buttonholes.\n[Doll's clothing] Short pull-on trousers of navy blue serge lined with white cotton, with braces made of self fabric and buttoning on to mother-of-pearl coloured buttons at the waist back and front\n[Doll's clothing] Long-sleeved shirt of white cotton with a turn-down collar, the cuffs and neck (originally with a placket opening) fastening with white buttons and stitched buttonholes.",
