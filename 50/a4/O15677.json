Registered File number 1986/1713.\n\nThis jacket was displayed in an exhibition at the V&A in Gallery 57, organised by the Exhibitions Section rather than the Fashion and Textiles department. The show brought together over twenty top international designers who were each invited by Blitz magazine to adapt, modify and reinterpret a classic denim jacket into a completely new design. For example, Joseph produced a knitted version with \"Joe's Angels\" on the back and a design of cherubs, and Rifat Ozbek heavily trimmed the basic jacket with military frogging, braiding and epaulettes. The jackets were all illustrated in Blitz. Following the exhibition at the V&A, the jackets were sold at a charity auction to benefit the Prince's Trust, at which time the Fashion and Textiles department purchased this Culture Shock jacket.\n-Daniel Milford-Cottam (2011)",
