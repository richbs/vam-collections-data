It has been held together by first yellow then red tape, which is now peeling.\n[box base insert] Several sheets of cardboard, folded and painted blue on uppermost side, stapled together to form an insert with four compartments.\n[box lid] Cardboard, printed with a picture of a yacht approaching a red buoy in a race, manned by three crew in yellow waterproofs, with other yachts sailing in the distance. In the bottom-left corner is a picture of the game being played by four people. Inside the lid, printed in black directly onto light-brown cardboard, are four squares containing written instructions; explanation of terms used, the 'class', points of sailing and dice symbols and their meaning. The word 'Helmsman' appears in white in the top-right corner, and on the sides of the lid. Clear tape is used to hold together corners where the cardboard has been torn.\n[instructions] Four sheets of paper folded in half to form a 16-page booklet (including covers), printed with instructions and rules in blue ink, held together by two metal staples.\n[instructions] Three sheets of paper folded in half to form a 12-page booklet (including covers), printed with instructions and rules in blue ink, held together by two metal staples.\n[game card] Light-brown card, with shiny white paper printed with text in black glued on one side.\n[game card] Light-brown card, with shiny white paper printed with text in black glued on one side.\n[bag of game pieces] Twelve plastic game pieces, in two designs. Six yachts, the hulls painted red, yellow, green, blue black and white, with white plastic sails and blue plastic bases. Six pointed flags, in light brown plastic with paper glued on, numbered 1 to 6 and decoracted with six different nautical flag designs in red, white, black, blue and yellow. All in a clear plastic bag (not original).\n[bag with pointer] Plastic pointer to be attached to the centre of the game board. The base of the pointer is tear shaped, made from clear plastic, with printed lines radiating from the centre in green and red. Also with a black line running from the centre to the tip of the point, terminating in and a black 'fleur de lys'. A piece of light brown plastic is attached, in the shape of a ship's wheel, and this provides the pivot which attaches the pointer to the board. It is in a clear plastic bag (not original).\n[bag of dice] Clear plastic bag (not original) containing 5 six-sided dice. One in white plastic, with recessed dots in red (for one and four) and black (for remainder of side).

The playing surface resembles a map of an ocean in light- and dark-blue, with stylised waves in white. Four areas of coast are visible at its edges, and four islands. In the centre is a large compass, also resembling an island, with eight points and a small hole in the centre to attach a plastic pointer. The area of sea is divided by a grid. Visible on the coastal areas and islands are images of  buildings, a lighthouse, a sunbathing woman, lobster pots, a yacht, a wrecked galleons, a mermaid and seals. There is a demarcated area in each corner, denoted by a hatched yellow boundary line and yellow buoy. Around the whole is a white border, in which the text 'Helmsman' and 'A Tri-ang game' appears twice, as well as the names of eight compass points, one each in the corners and mid-way along the four sides.",
