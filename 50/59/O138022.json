Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nThe most popular necklace was a choker, made of several chains fastened at the front with a large decorative snap clasp.  These are often decorated with filigree and coloured pastes.  Swedish traditional jewellers made lavish use of coloured glass.  Red was the most popular colour, as everywhere in Europe, but Swedish women were also fond of a clear blue which is rare elsewhere.  There is a small loop on the lower edge of the clasp.  This would originally have held a small pendant heart.\n\nThe clasp on this necklace is marked with the griffin town mark of Ystad, and the maker's mark AII.  Anton Jacob J\u00f6rgensson was a silversmith who worked in Ystad from 1818-1854.",
