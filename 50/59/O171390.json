Barnum.\n\nWhen P.T.Barnum arrived with Tom Thumb in England in 1844, he was warned that the English would not pay a high entrance fee to see him. In order to build up Tom Thumb's popularity, Barnum began by renting a mansion in the fashionable West End of London, and only allowing the rich and titled in society to visit by appointment. Only then did Tom Thumb begin to perform at the Egyptian Hall to the general public. Queen Victoria asked to meet him shortly after the show opened, which increased his popularity and the Hall played to packed houses for four months.\n\nThe Egyptian Hall on London's Piccadilly opened as a museum of curiosities in 1812, to display William Bullock's natural history collection. The building had an Egyptian style facade or front to it, and held 'upwards of fifteen thousand natural and foreign curiosities, antiques, and productions of the fine arts'. The collection was auctioned in 1819 and the hall became known instead as 'England's Home of Mystery', a famous venue for magic or illusionist acts. The building was demolished in 1905 and an office block named Egyptian House (170-173 Piccadilly) now stands on the site.",
