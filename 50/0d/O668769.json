            "history_note": "Historical significance: Giambattista Brustolon studied printmaking under Joseph Wagner (1706-1780). He worked mainly as a reproductive engraver for the best Venetian publishers and is best known for his prints after works by Canaletto. His prints use a technique that combines etching with engraving. He probably best known for the various series of engravings after works of the great Venetian view painter Antonio Canaletto (1697-1768) that he made during his career. In 1763 Brustolon produced a series of 12 engravings titled <i>Prospectuum aedium, viarumque insigniorum urbis Venetiarum</i> for the publisher Ludovico Furlanetto. This series of prints, dedicated to Doge Marco Foscarini (reg 1762-3), initially comprised of 12 views of Venice after Canaletto. In 1766 he produced for the same publisher the <i>Feste Dogali</i> a series of 12 scenes showing festivals and ceremonies of the Doge, again derived from drawings by Canaletto. This was to become Brustolon's most famous series of prints. He began a set of 29 architectural Capriccios after drawings by Canaletto in 1779, which were never completed. The following year he requested the exclusive rights for 22 prints of views of Rome based on drawings by Canaletto which had been given to the Brustolon by the artist's heirs. \n\nThis print, showing the <i>Coronation of the Doge on the Scala dei Giganti,</i> is from the series of 12 prints representing the various ceremonies and festivals of the Doges titled the <i>Feste Dogali</i> (festivals of the Doge). In this print the Doge stands at the head of the staircase whilst the senior counsellor crowns him with the jewelled <i>cornu</i>. The staircase is lined with musketeers whilst a crowd watches from below. Caligraphic gestures are employed for the figures in the crowd to show them applauding at the spectacle. A piece of tapestry or embroidery hangs from the window from which the Doge will address the populace following his coronation. Only 10 of the 12 original drawings by Canaletto survive for this series of prints. The drawing for <i>Coronation of the Doge on the Scala dei Giganti</i> survives in a private collection. Comparison of the print with the drawing shows that they correspond closely.",
