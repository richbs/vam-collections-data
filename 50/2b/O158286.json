Pieced: 2 large rectangular pieces have been added down the right hand side.  This disrupts the pattern a little.  It is seamed across the upper part. Directional design with the top of the pattern at the bottom of the panel, so that the wearer saw the correct pattern. The Museum Number is in the lower left. No borders survive.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in green and blue.\n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: red trefoil flower on a straight chevron stem pointing either to the right or straight down.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] diamond segments with a right facing red flower edged with yellow on a straight stem with 2 more red flowers and 3 yellow edged pale flowers alternating with a diamond with a downward pointing red blossom on a straight stem surrounded by 9 small serrated flowers and an outer band of coloured flowerheads.\n[b] trefoil base with 3 pale flowers forming the bottom of a downward pointing arrangement of flowers alternating with almost an identical pattern facing right.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; blue, dark blue, red, pink, white, light green, dark green, green, very pale green.",
