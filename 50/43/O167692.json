All are derived from the head of Christ in the bronze group of 'Christ and St. Thomas' executed between 1466 and 1438 for the niche on Orsanmichele in Florence (now in the Museo Orsanmichele) by Andrea del Verrocchio. They were doubtless produced by several workshops, including Verrocchio's, and by Giovanni della Robbia in unglazed terracotta. This one relates more closely to Giovanni della Robbia in style and may date to the early 16th century",
