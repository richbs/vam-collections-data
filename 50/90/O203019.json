By 1895 his sons had joined the company and it was renamed once again to Levy Sons &amp; Co. (or Levy et ses Fils).

It is the most narrow section of the Hinterrhein valley on the way to the important San Bernardino Pass (2,065m asl). This important north-south connection has been used for millennia to cross the Alps.  Stone Age and Megalithic remains are found here as well as Celtic and Roman. \nThe name is of Roman origin, created when the Roman road between Lindau and Milano used this route. The reason for the name is obvious: the valley narrows to a deep gorge and it is dangerous to cross it.  In Roman times there was no road, but only a narrow trail, which was high above the gorge and thus included some ascent and descent. Some small sections are visible from the old bridge, marked with signs showing Roman travellers had been there.  The first proper road was built in 1473, however the first time it was mentioned to be completed was not until 1723.  It has been redone at various points in history since then. There is an old road which is still used today but there is also a new four lane motorway which bypasses the gorge through two long tunnels.",
