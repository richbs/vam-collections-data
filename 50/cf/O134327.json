            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, pp. 136-37\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"\nLANDSEER, Charles, RA (1799-1879) \nBorn 1799, son of the engraver John Landseer and elder brother of Sir Edwin Landseer. Taught by his father and B R Haydon, and entered RA Schools 1816. Travelled in Portugal and Rio de Tanciro, making studies and sketches, in the 1820s. Exhibited 73 works at the RA between 1828 and 1879, 26 at the BI 1822-46, and 12 at the SBA 1824-35. Most were genre, historical and literary subjects. Elected ARA 1837, RA 1845; Keeper of Antique School 1851-73. Died London, 22 July 1879. His studio sale was at Christie's 14-16 April 1880. \nLIT: \tArt Journal 1879, p217 (obit); Illustrated London News 2 August 1879, ppl09-10, (obit with engr portrait); Athenaeum 2 August 1879, pp153-4 (obit) \n\nThe Temptation of Andrew Marvell \nFA103 Neg GA 1184\nCanvas, 101.6 X 126.9 cm (40 X 50 ins) Sheepshanks Gift 1857 \nExhibited at the RA in 1841, with the following unattributed passage quoted in the catalogue: \nAndrew Marvell represented Kingston-upon-Hull in the Parliaments of Charles the Second's time, and the Merry Monarch was much delighted with his lively conversation. On the morning after an evening spent in Marvell's society, the King sent the Lord Treasurer Danby with a particular message from himself, and to request his acceptance of 1,000 guineas. Marvell lodged on the second floor in a court near the Strand; his Lordship found him writing, and delivered his errand. 'Pray what had I for dinner yesterday?' said Marvell, appealing to the servant. 'A shoulder of mutton, sir'. 'And what have I to-day?' 'The remainder, hashed'. 'And tomorrow, my Lord, I shall have a sweet blade-bone broiled; and I am sure, my Lord, His Majesty will be too tender in future to bribe a man with golden apples, who lives so well on the viands of his native country'. The Lord Treasurer withdrew with smiles, and Andrew Marvell sent to his bookseller for the loan of a guinea. \nThe Art Union criticised the narrative: 'It lessens somewhat the merit of the refusal to receive it, that it (the bribe) is given in the presence of two servitors to the briber as well as the domestic of the patriot. Vraisemblance is therefore wanting'. But the work 'has high merits. The figures are carefully drawn, and strongly characteristic; and the picture is boldly and yet delicately coloured'. On the other hand, the Athenaeum critic found the 'general sentiment' satisfactory, but \nits features in detail less so. Instead of the bland smile of an easy mind, there is almost a simper upon the lips of the patriot ... the flesh-colours are pale and paste-like, and the handling wants firmness. In short, here again we feel the want of that earnesness and study which is characteristic of English art, to the deterioration of much bright and available talent. \nWhen the Art Journal reproduced an engraving after the painting in 1864, it set aside 'the historical truth of the narrative', commenting: \n'Artists and poets are permitted certain licenses, and Mr Landseer must be allowed what he has been pleased to take here. The merit of the work consists chiefly in the individuality of each figure, its agreeable expression, and in the extremely careful manner in which both they and all the accessories are painted; in colour, too, it is good'. \nVarious engraved portraits of Marvell appeared in editions of his poems; Landseer's image of the poet may be compared with that of an anonymous 17th-century painter in the NPG (554). \nEXH: \tRA 1841 (17); Andrew Marvell Tercentenary Exhibition, Guildhall, Hull, 1921 \nENGR:   J Stancliffe, in Art Journal 1841, p427; Art Union 1841, p75; Art Journal 1864, p232 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
