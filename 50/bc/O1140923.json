            "public_access_description": "This design for a tiara by Charlotte Isabella Newman is from an album of designs produced for the firm of John Brogden (1864-1884). This album contains 1,593 designs for jewellery and goldsmith's work, mainly in colour and dating between 1848 and 1884.  Designs like this one are in terms of shape and form, inspired by the art of the classical period. Classical antiquity is a long period of history centered on the Mediterranean Sea, comprising the interlocking civilizations of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. This period is conventionally taken to stretch from roughly the 7th or 8th century BC to the 5th century AD.  Such a design demonstrates the resourcefulness which made Newman indispensable to Brogden. Newman's use of different styles led to her becoming the first woman artist-jeweller in Victorian London.  Newman trained at the Government Art School in South Kensington before joining the Brogden firm as a designer, probably in the mid-1860s.\n\nThe firm was founded by John Brogden the elder in about 1796.\nFrom about 1824 to 1831 it was styled 'Brogden & Garland' and thereafter until 1841 'Garland & Watherston'. The younger Brogden, the son of Thomas Brogden and presumably a relative of the founder, served an apprenticeship to J.W. Garland as a goldsmith and jeweller from 1834 to 1841. Following Garland's departure, the remaining partner, J. H. Watherston, removed the firm to new premises at the 16 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden and in 1848 joined forces with the younger Brogden.",
