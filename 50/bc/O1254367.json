The evening's bill includes singing and comedy acts, but also a ladder-balancing act from Satsuma &amp; Ona and ventriloquism from Johnson Clark (1886-1956) who was known as 'the sportsman ventriloquist' and who performed with his vent doll, the naughty boy Hodge.\n\nSince this was a 'twice-nightly' programme there were two separate performances each evening, at 6.40pm and 8.55pm, and on Sundays there were feature films.",
