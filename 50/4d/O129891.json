            "public_access_description": "This is the design for the model of the figure of 'The Shield of Faith' by the sculptor, James Redfern (1837-1876), in about 1865 to1867 for the fl\u00e8che, or spire, of the Albert Memorial that was intended to be electroformed in copper but was not executed in this form. Instead a different figure of Faith, crowned, holding aloft a cross and a chalice, was electroformed and erected on the fl\u00e8che of the Albert Memorial, Hyde Park, London, which George Gilbert Scott designed, and which was completed in 1874, to commemorate Prince Albert. This design is for Francis Skidmore (1817-1896) for electroforming the figure which he was to undertake at his firm, Skidmore's Art Manufactures and Constructive Ironwork Company, in Coventry. The figure was then to be attached to the fl\u00e8che of the Albert Memorial and gilded in situ. \n\nThis is a working design and the back of the tracing paper of the design has been rubbed with graphite to transfer the design of the figure from this surface to another. The design has been squared up for transfer to a larger surface. The figure is coloured in with a pink wash and set against a brown wash background. In addition, the design could have served as a presentation drawing for George Gilbert Scott and the Committee charged with the construction of the Albert Memorial.",
