            "public_access_description": "Although traditional jewellery was worn throughout Sweden, and has a distinct Swedish character, there are marked differences between the different provinces.   Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nWhen Sweden became Protestant in 1527, Swedish women continued to wear crosses like their medieval predecessors.  The most typical Swedish cross is the tau (T-shaped) cross, also called the cross of St Anthony, from Sk\u00e5ne.  Sweden is the only country which has tau crosses among its traditional jewellery.\n\nThe oldest tau crosses were made from solid metal.  In the late 18th century the silversmiths of Kristianstad started to mass produce these crosses from two sheets of thin stamped silver, soldered together round the edge, with a chain trimming to cover the joint.  The silversmiths of Ystad retaliated by copying the popular Kristianstad patterns in their own heavier one-piece style.  The back of Ystad crosses, like this one, is flat, and the chain trimming purely decorative.  Many pieces of Swedish traditional jewellery use the renaissance motif of an angel's head with wings.  The hollow ball below the loop is also typical of Swedish traditional jewellery.\n\nThis cross is marked with the date letter N4 for 1843, the griffin mark of Ystad, and the maker's mark J. J\u00d6RGENSON.  Anton Jacob Jorgensson was a silversmith working in Ystad from 1818 to 1854.  It also has the number 4 3/8 scratched on the back.  This probably represents its original weight in lods, which is about 70 grams.",
