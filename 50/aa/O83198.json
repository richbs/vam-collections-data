Casts such as this began to be popular in the early nineteenth century and were an important and impressive portion of the early collections of what was then the South Kensington Museum (later V&A). The Architectural Courts, as the Cast Courts were originally known, opened in October 1873, and were built specifically to house the Museum's substantial cast collection.",
