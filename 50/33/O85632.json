            "physical_description": "Painting, in opaque watercolour on paper, a night scene with a kneeling lady with two female attendants visiting a hermit seated in front of a cave in a wooded landscape under a starry sky and crescent moon.  In the immediate foreground is a stretch of water with  three pairs of diminutive birds at its edge. Above this the group of  three figures sit by an open fire while a fourth stands on the left hand side holding a bowl full of pink sweetmeats or flower heads.  All the figures, except the lady, are shown in robes of muted colours of grey and pink.  By contrast, the lady is bejewelled and dressed  in a golden material decorated with crimson flowers and a deep burgundy-coloured <i>patka</i>, over which is draped a white <i>odhani</i> spotted in gold with a green and gold border.   She is shown in profile kneeling with her hands joined together in reverence slightly bowing towards the yogi who sits cross-legged with his right hand held out towards her.  He is a <i>kanphata</i> yogi, identified by the heavy earring hanging from his left ear-lobe.  He has orange and red horizontal lines with a central circle smeared across his forehead.  He wears two simple bangles round his visible left wrist and holds a rosary of <i>rudraksha</i> beads in his right hand in his lap.  He wears a small amulet on a chain round his neck over his simple pink robe worn under a large enveloping white shawl. Over the robe, but under the shawl he has two sacred threads across his body, on which are attached what appears to be white strips of fabric or bunches of threads. He wears a simple turban wound round his head.  The other sitting figure on the right is similarly dressed in a pink robe with a white shawl with a conical-shaped turban. This figure who is looking up towards the two central people in the scene is female and appears to be a young acolyte of the yogi.  She has a number of beaded necklaces probably made of <i>rudraksha</i> seeds round her neck and also holds a rosary of these same beads.\n  The pale brown frame round the painting is decorated with a scrolling pattern of alternate daisy-like flowers and trefoils in gold.  It is outlined with black and white lines and a gold washline edged with a dark blue outline.  The border comprises a row of alternate red poppy flowers and buds with single blooms of pink lilies outlined in gold.  The edge of the page has a blue-green margin made of collaged strips of paper outlined in white. A grey strip of paper has been added to the right hand edge of the page to act as a gutter for the binding.  Remnants of a red band round the edges of the page is still apparent under the present paper margins and gutter.",
