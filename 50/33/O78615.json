            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis is an important and rare oval gold box, thought to have been a pill, snuff or cachou box, because of its small size. Snuff was a form of  powdered tobacco, which was pinched between the fingers and inhaled. Cachous were small pills or lozenges made from the extract of liquorice or cashew-nut and were used by smokers in order to sweeten their breath. Gold boxes were unusual, even in this lavish age, and this one may have been a gift from Charles II (ruled 1660-1685) or his wife, Catherine of Braganza (1638-1705).\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe box has a flush hinge and an  iron closing clasp that operates on a catch release.  Although there are no hallmarks, the underside of the box is engraved with the crest of Finch surmounted by a Baron's coronet, whilst the lid is decorated with the reverse cipher 'HF' in applied gold wire. This is thought to be the monogram of Heneage Finch, a distinguished official at the court of Charles II. Gold wares made after 1677 should bear the maker's mark, unless excused by the Goldsmiths' Company, but this box does not.\n\nPeople\nHeneage Finch (1621-1682) was educated at Westminster School, London, and Christ Church College, Oxford. He then studied law at the Inner Temple in London.  In 1660 he was made both Solicitor-General and Baronet of Ravenstone, Buckinghamshire.  He immediately became the official representative of the Court in the House of Commons. In 1670 he was appointed Attorney-General and councillor to Queen Catherine, consort of Charles II. and in 1673 he was created Keeper of the Great Seal. In 1674 he became Baron Finch of Daventry and was awarded the title of Lord Chancellor the same year. He was created 1st Earl of Nottingham in 1681.\n\nTime\nThis box probably dates to the seven- year period during which Heneage Finch was entitled to use the Baron's coronet, as Baron Finch of Daventry (January 1674-May 1681).",
