Studied with BR Haydon, entered the RA Schools 1817 (at the age of 14); won annual prizes of the Royal Society of Arts 1813-17. A precocious and prodigious talent, as both painter and draughtsman, he exhibited - in a long and distinguished career - 179 works at the RA between 1815 and 1873, 94 at the BI 1818-65, and four at the SBA 1826-32. \nSubjects included portraits, but predominantly dealt with animal and human genre, often based in Scotland. Elected ARA 1826 (at the earliest permitted age), RA 1831. Received the patronage of the Russell family, and - most importantly- that of the Royal family, to whom he was Drawing Master, beginning in 1836 with the Duchess of Kent (Queen Victoria's mother); most significantly, he represented in visual form the Queen and Prince Albert's love for the life and landscape of the Scottish Highlands. Together with George IV's celebrated visit to Edinburgh 1822, and the great popularity of Sir Waiter Scott's Waverley novels, Landseer's contribution to the place of Scotland in European culture in the 19th century was considerable. The artist's own popularity was increased by the great number of reproductive prints after his works (Graves alone lists 434 by 126 engravers, see Lit below); his 'Monarch of the Glen' (exh, RA 1851), commissioned by the House of Lords but the cost refused by the House of Commons, was eventually bought by Sir Thomas Dewar and reproduced on his family firm's whisky bottle labels. Also significant was his anthropomorphic treatment of animals, particularly dogs; the <u>Art Journal</u> obituarist stressed that 'his dogs are not mere portraits only, they are thinking, almost rational, creatures, wanting only the gift of speech to hold converse with us'. Knighted 1850; offered PRA 1865, but refused, almost certainly because of his poor physical and mental health. Died London 1 October 1873; buried in St Paul's Cathedral. His studio sale was at Christie's 8-15 May 1874; a commemorative exhibition was held at the RA 1874/5. After the Royal Collection, the V&A possesses the largest holding of Landseer's works; there are a great many drawings and prints as well as the oils catalogued below, principally from the Sheepshanks Gift, one of the artist's most important patrons. \n\nLIT: F G Stephens <u>The Early Works of Sir Edwin Landseer RA</u> 1869; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by Sir Edwin Landseer </u>... 1873; <u>Art Journal </u>1873, p326 (obit); interleaved copy of 1874 RA exhibition catalogue, annotated by C S Mann, with photographs of prints after Landseer, 1874-7,4 vols (National Art Library, V&A); A Graves <u>Catalogue of the Works of the Late Sir Edwin Landseer</u> 1876; C Monkhouse entry in DNB; C Lennie Landseer: Victorian Paragon 1976; R Ormond <u>Sir Edwin Landseer</u> Philadelphia Museum of Art and Tate Gallery exhibition catalogue 1981 (With full bibliography).\n\n\n\n<b>Comical Dogs</b> \nFA l00 Neg GG4951 \nPanel, 69.8 X 76.2 cm (27\u00bd X 30 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the BI in 1836, the works shows clearly the increasing whimsical anthropomorphism that interested the artist. The critic of the <u>Examiner</u>, who found the painting 'irresistible', went on to comment that the right-hand dog 'who looks up, it is clear, to his master's face, is expressed inimitably. An inferior artist would have made them seem conscious of the ludicrous figure they cut. Mr. Landseer, while he gives them all the intelligence of the canine nature, never plays with the falsehood of a fanciful or humanised expression'. This latter statement, to say the least, is open to question. The <u>Athenaeum </u>thought it 'one of the best things in the gallery' but:\n\nWe are perplexed to know whether more to admire the fun of the<i> party </i>\n(to speak as the diplomats do) in the grandmother's cap, with the stump \nof a pipe in his mouth, or the drier humour of him in the shepherd's \nbonnet, with the mull <i>at his paws. </i>This picture is sure to attract many \ngazers - who will forget the slightness of its execution in the quaintness of its design. \n\nLennie calls these dogs 'absurdly dressed-up tykes', and 'though they deliberately exploited quaintness, they did not falsify expression; they were, however, the forerunners of the insufferably cute newspaper photographs showing a litter of puppies or kittens suspended inside a row of socks on a washing-line'. We might update this comment to include the presentation of animals on the television programme 'That's Life!'.\n\nEXH: BI 1836 (10) \n\nENGR: Charles G Lewis, for<u> Art Journal</u> 1877, facing p80; Samuel A Edwards 1886, as pl 6 of <i>Works of Sir Edwin Landseer </i>RA (first series 1881-93) \n\nLIT: <u>Athenaeum </u>1836, p147; <u>Examiner</u> l836, p213; <u>Graves</u> (unnumbered, listed under the year 1836); <u>Art Journal </u>1877, p80; Mann III, p1l5; F G Stephens <u>Sir Edwin Landseer </u>1881, p76; J Manson <u>Sir Edwin Landseer </u>1902, p87; <u>Lennie</u> pp88, 182 \n\n\n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"\nJulius Bryant, ed. <u>Art and Design for All.
