Unlike stained-glass panels from the medieval period, no lead lines are used to form the design. The imagery is painted on the glass, similar to painting on a canvas.\n\nThis type of glass decoration began to emerge in the middle of the 16th century due to improvements in glass and paint technology. To produce the enamel colours, metallic oxides were added to a glass frit mixture. The resulting colour range included blues, reds and greens, as we see here.\n\nA much wider range of colours can be obtained from enamel paints, but this surface-applied colour lacks the richness and transparency of glass coloured in the mix (pot metal). The imagery can often appear very dark.\n\nThis roundel was probably commissioned by the community of Menzingen in the Swiss canton of Zug, the arms of which are depicted at the base.\n\nThe central image is of the Virgin Mary holding the Christ Child. Mary is crowned as Queen of Heaven and holds a sceptre in her right hand. She stands on a crescent moon, an emblem of her chastity. \n\nOn her right St John the Baptist holds a lamb, a reference to his declaration when he beheld Jesus Christ: 'Behold the Lamb of God' (Agnus Dei). \n\nThe identity of the saint on Mary's left is uncertain. He wears antique Roman dress and carries a palm branch. This indicates that he was martyred during one of the persecutions carried out by the Roman authorities before the emperor Constantine legalised Christianity in 313. He may well be the patron saint of the community of Menzingen.",
