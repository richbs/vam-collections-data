Oval</i> 46 x 60 cm.                        P.7-1967 \n\n<i>Note:</i> Lutterell was a portrait painter in pastel, and this is one of his very few known figure subjects.  The composition is derived from the <i>Last Judgement</i> by Christoph Schwarz of Munich (c.1545-92).  The original painting by Schwartz, for Renata, Duchess of Lorraine (wife of William V of Bavaria), is lost, but many versions survive, including one in the Alte-Pinakothek, Munich.  H. Geissler, <i>Christoph Schwarz</i> (MS thesis, Freiburg im Br. 1960), Cat. G.111. 13, lists 29 paintings and 5 drawings after this composition.
