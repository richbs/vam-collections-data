The brattishing at [the] top would look best with double moulding if you can afford it. [There is a quick sketch in the text to illustrate this point] Please do send down the frames as soon as you can for I am anxious to finish off the Chapel'.\n\nThis is one of a number of designs for picture frames for the Earl of Shrewsbury. Pugin and J. G. Crace collaborated on the decoration of Alton Towers for the Earl of Shrewsbury.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
