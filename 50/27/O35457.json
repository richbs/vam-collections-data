Head of pink cotton painted to show rosy cheeks, a red smiling mouth, eyes glancing to\nthe right, light brown wool hair, brown felt wide brimmed hat. Hands are formed from the wire framework bound with pink fine wool. Body padded and covered with coloured felts and cottons to represent clothing - cream felt shirt with red cuffs, purple felt bolero trimmed with orange and green, black leather cloth cummerbund with blue and orange thread stitches, multicoloured striped cotton breeches, black leather cloth boots. Feet are flat and moulded from lead, painted black. \n*Margarete Cohn registered her trademark GRECON in Germany in 1920 and in 1940 in England having moved to London in 1937 from Berlin. From premises in Streatham High Road she made the cloth dolls, also using outworkers. Many of the dolls were sold in Hamleys, Harrods and Liberty's and both a dolls' house size was produced as well as a larger group which were often used by child guidance clinics to enable children to express themselves about their fears and resentments. Miss Cohn exhibited for many years at the British Industries Fairs and others and continued working until the 1980s. She died aged 96 in 1991.",
