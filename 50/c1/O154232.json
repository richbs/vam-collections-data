They were seeking a fresh approach to colour but preferred to work with traditional rather than new materials and create a unique technique and style. \n\nJamie Bennett broke with all tradition and removed the visible metal supports usually found in enamelling. This gave his enamelled compositions a painterly effect. He developed this new technique when making the 'Priori' series, as seen here. Bennett applied rough, granular enamel to give a softened outline and subtle surface patterning to his abstract three-dimensional forms. \n\nHe studied at the State University of New York at New Paltz. He originally trained as a painter and turned later to metalwork to create more sculptural forms. Through his novel application of enamels Bennett has gone back to his roots as a painter.",
