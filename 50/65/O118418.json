They frequently also gave further rings as souvenirs to their  friends. The practice came to an end when the office was abolished by  the Judicature Act of 1875. New mottoes were chosen at each call; the  rings differing in value according to the rank of their recipients. The rings  were generally gold with a suitable motto inscribed around the outer  hoop although some early examples appear to have been enamelled.\n\nThe custom of giving rings is described by Sir John Fortescue around  1470 in 'De Laudibus Legum Angliae' as follows: all serjeants at their  appointment \"shall give rings of gold to the value of forty pounds at the  least, and your Chancellor well remembreth that at the time he received  this state and degree, the rings which he then gave stood him in fifty  pounds\"  (De Laudibus Legum Angliae c.59). A full description of the  investiture ceremonies and a list of mottoes up to 1765 was given by Mr  Serjeant Wynne in Observations touching the Antiquity and Dignity of  Serjeants at Law , 1765.",
