The exhibition was opened by the fourteen-year old Molly Sheldrake, billed as Britain's youngest Punch and Judy performer and seen kneeling in this photograph. The exhibition drew large crowds and ran from the 24th to the 30th October 1938, featuring almost 250 puppets and demonstrations by 25 different troupes giving about 70 demonstrations.  There was a lot of publicity, and in his article on the exhibition in the periodical The World's Fair, 5 November 1938, Gerald Morice noted that Tuesday 25th October was a foggy, wet and cold day but that they filmed scenes from a marionette show all morning, from in front and behind, for British Movietone News. He added that all the national daily papers with the exception of The Daily Mirror carried stories about the exhibition, mostly with photographs, and that Molly as 'the youngest Punch and Judy performer in the country' really caught the press's imagination.",
