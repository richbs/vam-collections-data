            "public_access_description": "David Bailey rose to fame as a fashion photographer in the early 1960s, his photographs. He published 'David Bailey's box of pin-ups' in 1965 as a loose portfolio of 36 portraits of the mainly-male fashionable elite that, as the cover description states, 'belong to Bailey's own world of fashion, pop music and the Ad Lib [nightclub]'. Each portrait is accompanied by notes by Francis Wyndham. Together, they constitute a celebration of the growing celebrity culture of the Sixties, and many of them have become the definitive images of key figures of cultural life in London during the Swinging Sixties.\nSurprisingly, only four of the pin-ups are women, all of whom are models, like Chrissie Shrimpton shown here. The cover notes explain why she qualifies for the set: 'Chrissie Shrimpton, model, has two claims to fame, both at second hand: she is Jean Shrimpton's sister and the girl friend of Mick Jagger.'",
