At first plain and utilitarian, shoe buckles became more elaborate as the 18th century progressed.\n\nMaterials & Making\nLike most silver buckles, this one was cast and chased to produce its decoration. The rectangular shape and cusped design of this shoe buckle are typical of the Neo-classical influence at work on late-18th-century men's clothing.\n\nOwnership & Use\nLarge shoe buckles and high heels were only part of the exaggerated styles of a certain group of fashionable young men in the 1770s. They also wore very high wigs, tightly cut coats and breeches in pastel shades and too much perfume (according to their critics). Such fashions were considered very effeminate. The term 'macaroni' was coined by young men on the Grand Tour for anything stylish and elegant. As many also adopted this new style of dressing, the expression was applied to them.",
