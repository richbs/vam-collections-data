It would have been accompanied by an \u2018aspergillum\u2019 or sprinkler. \n\nBuckets like this one were first made in brass because grander versions than simple wooden examples were required for liturgical ceremonies. Initially there were many basic similarities between the two. Brass buckets copied the tapering profile of wooden buckets. They were decorated with horizontal lines encircling the rim, centre and base that resembled the metal hoops that held the wooden staves together. \n\nGradually metalworkers began to evolve forms particular to brass. They cast buckets with a circular stepped foot which they could decorate with a pattern of perforations. They sometimes incorporated inscriptions around the side of the vessel on the more elaborate examples. Handles were often a single iron hoop but some examples, like this one, had double hooped handles. \n\nThey also produced buckets for secular use but church commissions prompted more variations in style. Throughout the Middle Ages, church art was more susceptible to changes of fashion than the highly conservative domestic market.\n\nBuckets were also produced for secular use but the stylistic variations were undoubtedly prompted by ecclesiastical commissions.  Throughout the Middle Ages, church art was more susceptible to changes of fashion than the highly conservative domestic market.",
