It was filled with iced water and glasses were hung upside down from the scalloped rim. From about 1690 many monteiths had detachable rims for conversion into punch bowls. \n\nTime\nMonteiths became fashionable in the 1680s and reached their height of popularity between 1698 and 1700. In December 1683 the diarist Anthony Wood recorded an early use of the monteith and attributed the name to 'a fantastical Scot called 'Monsieur Monteigh' who at that time or a little before wore the bottom of his cloake or coate so notched U U U U...'. It is doubtful that this character had any connection with the introduction of the monteith but no other explanation has been found for the name. Monteiths fell out of fashion by about 1720 and were rarely made after 1725.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis monteith is made from Britannia standard silver, an alloy with a greater silver content than sterling silver. By the end of the 17th century, the practice of goldsmiths 'clipping' sterling silver coins for their own use had become so widespread that it threatened to debase the coinage. In 1697, the Crown ordered that all silverware should be made from the higher standard of Britannia silver. The law was repealed in 1720, when enormous quantities of silver became available from the Americas. Thereafter goldsmiths could choose to use either standard.",
