The subject, which seems uncommon in art, is from Livy's <i>History of Rome</i>: the brother of the Roman Consul Scipio, Publius Scipio Africanus, lieutenant in the Roman army, had his young son captured by the enemy, whose leader the Asian King Antiochus, hearing of Africanus's illness, sent ambassadors to return him to his father. The relevant passage dealing with the reconciliation scene occurs in book 37 chapter 37: 'As this present was highly grateful to the mind of the father, so was the satisfaction which it gave no less salutary to his body. At length, being sated with the embraces of his son, he said to the ambassadors, 'Tell the King that I return him thanks ... '' ' (translated A A M 'De Vitte, vol 4, 1850 pp1693-4). \nThe work shows the influence of French neoclassical painting, particularly of David and his school in the use of decisive hand gestures; Smith supposedly studied with Ingres on his way back from Rome, presumably in 1833, which is too late for any effect on the present work, but Smith may have associated with young French artists at their Academy in Rome. The likeness of Scipio was possibly taken from a profile portrait on a coin, such as the example in the National Museum, Stockholm. \nThe work is damaged by a long tear, sustained, it is presumed, during the First World War. However a reasonably good photograph exists in the museum's files, and conservation has been started. \n\nEXH: RA 1833 (537) \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
