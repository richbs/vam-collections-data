The text of a Sanskrit commentary is inserted in small Nagari characters in the margins. Central and marginal string-holes are decorated but not pierced and on the obverse of each folio the central hole only is marked. Folio numbers are written in the lower right-hand corner of the reverse of each folio but are defective from folio 85 onwards due to insect damage. The colophon is written in red on f.92 verso (see Marks). A painting on the left side labelled 'Harsa' (joy) although the inscription is in a very different, presumably later, hand. This (verso) side shows Trishala, dressed in her finery and attended by the maid, looking in her mirror. The remaining area of the page is covered with text.",

Jainism is one of the oldest religions to have survived until the present time and its basic teaching is one of non-violence.  The Kalpasutra is divided into three sections.   The first section deals with the lives of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirthankaras, who were the Jain spiritual teachers or 'ford-makers'.  The second part deals with the life of Mahavira, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara.  The third part deals with rules for the ascetics and laws during the four months (chaturmas) of the rainy season, when ascetics temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst the laity. This is the time when the festival of Paryushan is celebrated and the Kalpasutra is traditionally recited.\nThe illustration on the front of this folio shows 'Shoka' or sorrow. Queen Trishala, who was to become mother of Mahavira, is grieving because the embryo has not stirred. She is consoled by a maid servant. On the reverse is another illustration showing Trishala's joy. Here, dressed in her finery, she looks in her mirror.",
