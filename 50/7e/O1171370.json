The design is for a wall  monument for an unidentified person.  Nollekens is best known as the leading portrait sculptor in Britain between 1770 and 1815. With his fellow Royal Academicians Thomas Banks and John Flaxman he established the British School of sculpture following decades of dependence on immigrant sculptors (such as Rysbrack, Scheemakers and Roubiliac). Flaxman praised Nollekens as the only sculptor before Banks who had \"formed his taste on the antique and introduced a purer style of art\". Opportunities to study the antique were plentiful whilst Nollekens lived for eight years from 1762-1770 in Rome. As a draughtsman he was exceptionally well trained for his day.",

The church has become redundant and the monument is at present on show at the Victoria and Albert Museum, who acquired it in 1970. The architectural treatment and the cherub heads show it to be the work of the 1770s. Consoles were made to flank the tablet, and a fluted string course was introduced  below the tablet.\n\nThis is a completely finished drawing, of a kind of which several examples are in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Such drawings were shown to his clients by Nollekens, who always kept a stock of them ready. \"200\" will refer to the cost of the work.'\n\nHistorical significance: 'Nollekens is best known as the leading portrait sculptor in Britain between 1770 and 1815, and as the subject of the biography Nollekens and his Times (1828) by J.T. Smith. With his fellow Royal Academicians Thomas Banks and John Flaxman he established the British School of sculpture following decades of dependence on immigrant sculptors (such as Rysbrack, Scheemakers and Roubiliac). Flaxman praised Nollekens as the only sculptor before Banks who had \"formed his taste on the antique and introduced a purer style of art\". As a draughtsman he was exceptionally well trained for his day. He is also noted as a collector; he owned the three wax reliefs by Giambologna now in the V&A. The V&A's collection includes three busts by Nollekens, five of his terracottas, his marble copy after the antique, Castor and Pollux (1767)and his original marble of Diana (1778).'\n\nJulius Bryant on RF 2010/245.",
