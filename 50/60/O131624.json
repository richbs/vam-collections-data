Nuno adhered this new synthetic directly onto an ordinary polyester weave, stitching it down in different patterns before applying heat.  This makes the new synthetic shrink and fuse at its polyester backing which ripples and buckles in strange ways.  A further increase in temperature to above 200 degrees centigrade causes the synthetic to distintegrate, leaving irregular organic pleats 'fixed' in the polyester.",
