The inscriptions and portrait indicate that this particular one is commemorative.\n\nPeople\nDuring the War of American Independence the French fought in alliance with the Americans. Towards the end of the war, when the English had been forced to end military operations in America, Admiral Rodney won a decisive naval victory off Dominica. The Battle of the Saints took place on 12 April 1782 and resulted in the capture of the French commander, the Comte de Grasse. The Derby factory made a number of these jugs moulded with the face of Admiral Rodney. \n\nThe features of Admiral Rodney are probably taken from a figure modelled by Pierre Stephan, a French craftsman who had earlier been the chief resident modeller at the Derby factory. Stephan was a valued and prolific worker. In 1819 he estimated that the models and moulds he had made between 1770 and 1778 were then worth the astonishing sum of \u01531,500 to the Derby factory. He probably based Rodney's features on a print by Valentine Green published in 1780.",
