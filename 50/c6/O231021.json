The robe is open down the front with a low, scooped neckline, but triangular panels have been added in an odd way at the bottom - looks messy. The satin has a purple-dark grey ground woven with yellow silk to form a leafy ogival lattice with a rosette with a green centre where the lines meet. The compartments contain one motif per row: either a white-petalled circular flower with two small blue and one pink bud above or an identical motif but with pink petals. There is evidence of a loom/piece end marked by a green and pink chevron changing direction. There is evidence of a selvedge which is green satin.\nA robe of a similar textile is depicted in the portrait of Mirza Abul Hassan Khan, envoy extraordinary from the Shah to George III, painted by Sir William Beechey in 1810 (Oriental and India Office Library).",
