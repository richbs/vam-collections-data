The Virgin Mary, with long hair and wearing a fillet on her head, stands on the left of the panel, facing Elizabeth, her couisn. Her right hand, forefinger extended, is held raised at waist level, her left hand rests on her cousin's abdomen as though to bless the unborn child. St. Elizabeth, wearing a barbe and a veil over her head, stands on the right of the panel facing the Virgin, her left hand raised at waist level, her right hand reaching under the Virgin's outstretched arm to rest on her abdomen. Both women wear gowns and cloaks over their shoulders. \n\nThe top of the panel is missing, the corners broken off behind the heads and shoulders of the women. There is a hole between the heads of the two figures. Green paint and the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground at the bottom of the panel. Considerable traces of paint and gilding remain on the panel, with small gesso bosses on the upper background. There is red in the folds of Elizabeth's cloak, blue in the folds of the Virgin's cloak and gilding on the Virgin's hair. There are traces of gilding on the background where red paint appears to have been used as a primer. The back of the panel is scratched with a Z. There are four lead-plugged holes, two with latten wires attached. The bottom has been cut away.",
