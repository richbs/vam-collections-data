They would be folded down at the side of the room between meals. A strongly-framed 'gate' developed that swung out from the main frame, now known as a gateleg. Gateleg tables remained popular well into the eighteenth century. \n\nThe moulded and scrolled three-lobed feet on this example has come to be known as a 'Braganza' foot, on the supposition that this design somehow came to England from Portugal with Catherine of Braganza, at the time of her marriage to Charles II in 1662. But this form was not in fact used on chairs or tables before 1700. Interestingly, it does also appear on Portuguese furniture of the early 18th century.",

The turning is of quite remarkable elegance, the proportions most graceful, while the scrolled feet are admirably modelled. The fact that the table is made of walnut adds greatly to its value and interest.' (A photograph of another table, with two flaps, for comparison (as an inferior piece) was attached tothe papers.)\n\nSeveral features help date this example to 1720-30. Whereas the tops of gateleg tables were initially fixed to the frame by means of pegs inserted from above, a different technique was used by the time this table was made, whereby the fixed central portion of the table-top was held using screws from underneath through gouges in the rails. \n\nBefore about 1720 the joint between the falling leaves and the fixed section of table top was usually formed by two butted squared edges, whereas after this date, as on this table, a more sophisticated 'rule' joint was used, where the folding leaf overlaps a convex moulding along the edges of the fixed portion, so that the joint is concealed.\n\nAdam Bowett, English Furniture 1660-1714, (Woodbridge, 2002), p.277, notes that standard metropolitan and provincial practice was to make the feet by adding a thickness of wood to the two outer faces of the leg. He suggests that scrolled feet are unlikely to predate 1710, based on chair feet chronologies. He suggests that the gateleg form established during the Restoration period continued after 1689 without significant modifcation.",
