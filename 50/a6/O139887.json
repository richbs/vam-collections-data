The design is annotated with both the figure of '\u00a325', which is the cost, and the dimensions of '3 feet' for width of the finished product. Francis Skidmore employed designers to work for him later in his career as his business expanded so this design is only possibly by him. The shape of the gaselier with upright jets and the central, pendant boss are like a photograph of a gaselier from the Skidmore design archive at the V&A. The photograph is inscibed 'Hereford Cathedral' on the back and thus dates to about 1862 (E.424-2006).  There are some similarities with a photograph of another gaselier (E.409-2006). This design was made at Skidmore's Art Manufactures and Constructive Ironwork Company at Alma Street, Coventry, founded in 1859. Skidmore was interested in the gas lighting of churches and worked with Sir George Gilbert Scott on the restoration of medieval, ecclesiastical buidlings. In addition, he was commissioned by Scott to work on new buildings such as the Midland Hotel, St. Pancras, London, in which he installed a lighting scheme.",
