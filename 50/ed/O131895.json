            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 222\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"\"O'CONNOR, James Arthur (?1792-1811) \nBorn Dublin, Eire, probably in 1792, son and pupil of the printseller and engraver William O'Connor; practised as an engraver, and studied painting with William Sadler. First exhibited Dublin 1809. Visited London with Francis Danby ARA 1813, returning there to live 1822. Exhibited 21 landscapes (several views around Dublin) at the RA between 1822 and 1840, 38 at the BI 1823-39, and 17 at the SBA 1829-1838. Visited Brussels 1826-7, Paris and Germany 1832-3. Health and eyesight declined; died Brompton, London, 7 January 1841; his studio sale was at Christie's 12 February 1842 (Art Union April 1845 made a financial appeal for his widow). Some of his works were exceptionally large; Bodkin proposed that his best paintings were on a smaller scale but seldom exhibited. S Redgrave (A Dictionary of Artists of the English School) in 1878 thought the landscapes 'boldly painted, show great feeling, and are good in tone and colour, but rather green', and Hutchinson in 1985 describes the artist as: \n\" Until about ten years ago ... possibly the best loved of all Irish painters. This affection ... was not based on any real knowledge of his paintings, but on an affinity with the lyrical mood of his most common landscapes, which, it was widely believed, always included tiny figures wearing red waistcoats walking down country lanes on fine summer days. \nLIT: \tGentleman's Magazine March 1841, p329, June 1841, p666 (obit); Dublin Monthly Magazine April 1842; W G Strickland A Dictionary of Irish Artists, Il, 1913, pp179-82 (with engr self-portrait); T Bodkin Four Irish Landscape Painters 1920, pp17-28; James Arthur O'Connor centenary exhibition catalogue, Municipal Gallery of Modem Art, Dublin, 1941; A Crookshank 'Early Landscape Painters in Ireland' Country Life 24 August 1972, pp468-72; A Crookshank and the Knight of Glin The Painters of Ireland 1978, p209; J Hutchinson James Arthur O'Connor NGI, Dublin, 1985 \n\n\nThe Devil's Glen, County Wicklow\n1841-1900 Neg GB580 \nCanvas, 34 X 43.1 cm (13 ? X 17 ins) Signed and dated 'J A O'Connor 1828' br \nAshbee Bequest 1900 \nOther versions of this subject were exhibited at the BI in 1828 (253 'A View in the Devil's Glen, Wicklow', size given in the catalogue as 14 by 16 inches, presumably including frame), and at the SBA in 1830 (466, 'Scene in the Devil's Glen, County of Wicklow'). 'The Devil's Gap' was exhibited at the BI in 1830 (454, size given as 28 by 29 inches). A painting of 'A View of the Devil's Glen' (about 1830, 63 X 76 cm (24 \u00be X 30 ins), NGI), shows a grimmer and different aspect of the scene. \nThe Devil's Glen is about a mile from Ashford, in the Wicklow mountains south of Dublin; the wooded glens, mountains, and the winding river Vartry and its waterfalls, seem to comprise O'Connor's favourite type of scenery. \nHutchinson suggests the present work 'gives us some intimation of the way O'Connor's style was to develop in the next decade. It is a skilful picture that has both a cheerful, gentle mood and a suggestion of the melancholy of the coming years'. \nPROV: Henry Spencer; bequeathed by H S Ashbee to the museum 1900 \nEXH: \tJames Arthur O'Connor NGI, Dublin, 1985 (62) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
