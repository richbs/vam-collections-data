Given his compelling personality, this was inevitable.  But she has a distinct artistic personality of her own. The present work is connected with a series of illustrations to Tennyson's The Palace of Art, commissioned by the publisher Edward Moxon for his fine edition of the poems, published in 1857; Rossetti tried to persuade Moxon to include Siddal's work, and she produced several subjects.  But in the event it was Rossetti who got the commission, and his illustration owes a great deal to the drawing here. The relevant lines from the poem are:\n  Or in a clear-walled city on the sea, \n  Near gilded organ pipes, her hair\n  Wound with white roses, slept St Cecily;\n  An Angel looked at her.\nMost of Siddal's subjects were female heroine/victims,ensuring her a special place in the history of women artists.  Cecilia is the patron saint of music; according to the legend,she was a Christian betrothed to a pagan, whom she told she had consecrated her virginity to God and that their marriage would never be consummated.  He accepted, and became a Christian, but was put to death. Cecilia was likewise arrested, but several attempts to kill her miraculously failed; eventually she was abandoned and simply left to die.  Here, an angel assists while Cecilia records on paper music from heaven.",
