Steiff made various animals on wheels ranging from dogs to horses and they came in a variety of sizes; some are large enough to carry a teddy bear. The oldest ones had wheels originally made of cast iron, which were often left in their natural state or painted bronze. This donkey has wooden wheels, which came next, in a varnished finish. By the 1930s, wheels could be rubber tired metal.",
