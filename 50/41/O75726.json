            "public_access_description": "Many middle-class homes in the later 19th century had a nursery. This room provided separate accommodation for the children of the family and the nursemaid, nanny and governess who looked after them. All kinds of furnishings were designed specially for children, including nursery wallpapers. The designs considered suitable for nursery wallpapers were either educational or morally improving subjects. These wallpapers were usually decorated with pictures. This paper has brightly coloured scenes of figures in landscape settings illustrating spring, summer, autumn and winter.",
