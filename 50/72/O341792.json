Just above the mid-point is a frieze of soldiers in relief after engravings by Virgil Solis and Theodore de Bry. There are bands of repeated grotesque lion masks of several sizes, including a large one just below the spout and another just above the foot where a metal tap for dispensing drink would originally have been inserted. An iron tube remains just inside this hole. Other decorative motifs include cherub masks, flowers and palm leaves.",

This region has rich resources of fine clay suitable for making stonewares. The whole surface is profusely decorated with incised, stamped and relief-moulded applied decoration picked out in cobalt blue. The frieze of soldiers derives from a design first used on Westerwald jugs in about 1580 but most of the motifs are Baroque in style and at least one suggests a date approaching 1700.\n\nThe enormous size of this vessel, combined with the presence of a hole just above the foot for a metal tap (now missing) indicate that it would have been filled with beer, water or possibly wine which could be dispensed via a tap into smaller jugs for table use. Decanting jugs were often kept on the floor during a meal but this one would need to have sat on a low table, bench or form in order to provide sufficient height for a servant to be able to hold a smaller table jug beneath.",
