The series was made using the technique of open-bite or deep-bite etching. Here the technique gives the appearance of an antique map, with eroded and rugged coastlines suggested rather than clearly defined. \n\nGiven that the artist is an \u00e9migr\u00e9 from the former Soviet Union, the title of this print calls to mind Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\u2019s novel The Gulag Archipelago (1973) about the vast system of penal labour camps scattered like invisible islands throughout Russia.  \n\nAnne Appelbaum, an American journalist who travelled to the former Soviet Union in the early 1990s, was struck by the absence of memory about these camps. Tsvetkov\u2019s work may both commemorate this reign of terror and acknowledge its loss from the collective memory. Like many artists from the former Soviet Union, Tsvetkov seems to have developed a way of making images that carry disturbing undertones but can also be read as something more innocent.",
