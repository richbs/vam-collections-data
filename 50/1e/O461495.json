The breast plate is of repousse iron decorated with an image of Shoki hunting demons; the helmet is in the shape of a Chinese court cap with an articulated iron dragonfly fore crest; the half-mask has a nosepiece in the form of the beak of a bird and a throat guard of lacquered plates laced with silk and a stencilled leather attachment; the foot guards, greaves and sleeves are of iron, the latter with appliqu\u00e9 iron badges. The figure is mounted on an original 19th century life-size Japanese mannequin known in Japanese as an 'iki-ningyo',literally 'living doll' seated on a folding campaign stool.",
