It consists of two parts, an outer vase and an inner cylinder which revolves inside it. The cylinder is painted and fixed to the vase at the neck and foot, while the outer vase has a pierced design which allows one to glimpse the patterns on the cylinder inside. Neck, body, base and inner cylinder were fired and decorated separately, and then skilfully mounted together. \n\nThe lavish decoration on the surface, painted in coloured and gold enamels on a blue background, reflects a style which was appreciated by the Chinese court during the 18th century. Revolving objects were produced for special occasions due to the difficulty of manufacture and became popular after the first revolving celadon bowl was presented to the Qianlong emperor in 1743.",
