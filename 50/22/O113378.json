This example of the chair has been retained unopened, when all the layers of paper are flat, to demonstrate a stage in the production of the chair. The paper shape is the side of the chair with the front of the seat on the left and the back on the right. To make the chair, the form would be stood upright on its base, and the paper structure would gradually be expanded on the left side to form the seat, making a fan shape that pivots from the right side. There is no other structure to the chair: the user simply sits on paper and air.",
