He was born and trained in Switzerland but worked in France from about 1830 to 1841 when he settled in London. In 1857, he was described as a  master watch engraver but the surviving material, although including watch dials, demonstrates wider involvement in the silversmithing trade from electrotyped dressing table boxes to engraved panels for carriage clocks. It is very rare to find so much documented material from one of the smaller suppliers to the trade. His work would have been largely anonymous and sold under the name of larger silversmiths or retailers of the Victorian period.\n\nIt has been suggested that this piece might have been intended to be a mount on a box or trophy stand.",
